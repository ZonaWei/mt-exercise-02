No ?
No ... You never learned how to speak my language .
Utapan , won 't you speak to me ?
You used to know how to speak to me .
You did the same to your God !
You have to find them , Utapan .
Look what they did !
Ask him if he will help .
He understands .
We will work with his people .
We want peace .
Ask the Chief if he understands ?
He has medicine .
Tell him we admire his people .
Chief says ... ... and also to bring medicine .
Chief says -- he has a God .
To bring the word of God .
Why ?
Thousands .
Chief says -- how many ?
Tell him his country is very beautiful .
Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort .
Chief knows .
Tell the Chief we thank him .
You come !
You speak first !
Island .
Far .
What is it ?
A tribe ?
An island ?
Say not here !
Cuba !
I don 't know ...
I have the impression that I didn 't change that much .
I still can 't accept the world as it is !
Oh ?
So you are a new man ?
New worlds create new people .
I knew you would .
I have to disagree .
You 'll always be older than me , Father .
I suppose we 're both old men now .
Give me absolution .
I believed in you ... You are bound by an oath , Father .
My son , my son ...
Your certitudes are sometimes frightening ... Christopher , you must speak to them .
And if you don 't I will .
If I tell them , they won 't follow me .
You know that I am right , Father .
You trust me ... May God forgive you ... !
You must tell them !
You must tell your men !
I am not sure ...
It could be twice the distance .
How long ?
I lied .
The journey will be longer than I said .
What are you saying ?
Father , I have betrayed my family .
I betrayed my men .
And I betrayed you .
I am listening , my son .
Forgive me , Father .
For I have sinned .
In Nomine Patris et Filius , et Spiritus Sancti .
Colon !
Don 't !
All of them !
Just lies !
Damn all of you !
You all set up theories based on what ?
You never leave the safety of your studies !
Go out !
Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to !
Colon !
Damn God !
If God intends you to go , then you will go .
Wait !
I 've waited seven years already !
How much longer do you want me to wait ?
You mustn 't give way to despair .
You must wait .
Only God knows the meaning of such words , my son .
I 've been contradicted all my life ... Eternity !
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
Passion is something one cannot control !
Father Marchena !
I 'll try to remember that , Marchena ... Two minutes ... and already you 're a dead man .
Don 't let passion overwhelm you , Colon .
So was Christ !
Esdras is a Jew .
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr , Esdras ... How can you be so certain ?
Ignorance !
I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands .
How can you be so certain ?
The Ocean is said to be infinite .
To open a new route to Asia .
At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it ... Why do you wish to sail west ?
With some difficulty .
I had to promise them you were not a total fool .
How did you manage it ?
That 's what it says .
God ... That 's in a week !
Father , I am doing what I think is the best for him .
And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself .
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious ... Brothers should be raised together , Colon .
Even brothers from different mothers ...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things .
I must see them with my own eyes .
I cannot be other than I am .
There is one thing I 'd like to understand ... Why do you want to go back , after all this ?
Thank you .
But without your brothers .
Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies .
You may explore the continent .
They come and go as naked as the day God created them ... Do they have such thoughts ?
Thirty seven , Your Majesty ... And you ?
How old are you , Senor Colon ?
A woman ?
I know what I see .
I see someone who doesn 't accept the world as it is .
Who 's not afraid .
I see a women who thinks ... " What if ? " ...
You show no inclination to speak otherwise !
May I speak freely ?
Surely you can do anything you want .
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council .
That she was impregnable .
What did they say about Granada before today ?
The ocean is uncrossable ?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors .
I should not even be listening to you , since my council said no .
But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity ... And Sanchez , that you are not a fool .
You will regret this .
You 'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions .
Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged .
Have you anything to say ?
Savagery is what monkeys understand .
In one act of brutality , you have created chaos .
<unk> who were fighting each other are now <unk> forces against us !
All that because of your criminal <unk> !
You did not hear me , Don Colon .
Not my horse .
Don Moxica -- we all have to work .
My horse doesn 't work .
We can 't raise the wheel without it .
We came here to stay !
To build !
Not to start a <unk> .
In this forest , there is enough danger to <unk> us away in days !
So we will be brave and swallow our grief .
And in the name of those who died , we will accomplish what we came for .
We don 't need to know .
You want a war ?
Fine .
We are a thousand .
They <unk> us by ten !
Who will you kill ?
Which tribe ?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you 'll do as I say .
We lost cousins , friends .
We will wash this in blood .
The <unk> have no such word , Don Moxica .
And you say this is an Indian vice ?
By God !
I don 't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
We can 't be .
He 's <unk> an isthmus ...
He 's saying we 're on an isthmus .
What 's he doing ?
Twenty eight .
What do you read ?
Come over here .
Well , I surely know what a <unk> is !
But I 've never seen it used at night before .
And what do you think Mendez ?
Well ...
It 's the men , Sir .
They wonder how you know our position .
We 've lost sight from land days ago ... God be with us admiral .
Due west , Captain Mendez .
And may God be with us ... You 're right .
Let the men decide .
You tell that to them !
Pinzon , Pinzon ... All we can do now is go forward !
Think about that !
You bloody ... You never did .
You did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
Jesus Maria !
I should have never listened to you !
And then what ?
Half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid !
You know that !
You don 't know anything !
Listen Colon , these are my ships , right ?
So I 'm telling you we 're turning back !
The land is there .
I know it !
We 're lost !
You think I don 't know that ?
We 're on the verge of a <unk> , Colon !
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
You must be mad ... !
Six days ago , yes .
You lied !
You <unk> !
We 're way past 750 leagues !
Immediately .
Where can I meet this man ?
Because he is not afraid of me .
Then why ?
I know , I should not tolerate his <unk> .
And who would you think of , for such a task ?
He must be replaced .
Then , what do you suggest , Don Sanchez ?
Is this true , <unk> <unk> ?
...
But there is worse .
He ordered the execution of five members of the <unk> ... We weren 't expecting <unk> <unk> , were we ?
We must have faith .
We must give time for time .
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying .
But with no gold !
The new world proves expensive , Your Majesty .
Yes .
It would be a pity , wouldn 't it ?
Call him back !
...
<unk> a <unk> ... Never , Your Majesty .
Although ... You were right , Don Sanchez ... His demands could never be granted .
Yes , Your Majesty .
Is that the man I knew , <unk> Sanchez ?
<unk> , there 's your killer , do your duty , arrest him !
... so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital ...
I don 't think it 's abuse , I think it 's torture .
I 'm abused .
Don 't you think ?
Can I see your back ?
Out on my back when I was a small boy .
Your father put cigarettes out on you ?
That 's what he did to me .
He put cigarettes out on me .
Yeah , he hated me from day when I was born .
Put it out .
Can you put the cigarette out ?
Your father blamed you for your mother 's blindness ?
Yeah , yeah ... bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind .
And my father blamed me for her blindness ... Back in the Czech <unk> ?
Yeah , she went blind giving <unk> to me .
She went to fucking black market doctor to <unk> me .
Your mother was blind ?
My father always <unk> me .
<unk> my <unk> .
And my mother was blind .
Tell me about yourself .
What you did as a young boy ... what your parents were like .
Give me another one , please .
I need to know about your background .
I need to know about your <unk> .
Why you 're here .
What else do you need ?
This is not about money , Emil .
I need your trust in me .
<unk> .
No more .
Or I call another lawyer .
This is the biggest case of your life .
Don 't try to negotiate .
Thirty percent .
Say yes or no .
But it 's ... No .
No way .
I would say ... half .
Half is fair .
What 's your cut ?
How much ?
Look , I haven 't really focused on that kind of thing .
What about my movie rights ?
<unk> rights ?
Don 't worry about him .
Think about yourself .
No , he is here .
Shit ...
<unk> .
They 're looking everywhere .
Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia .
What about Oleg ?
Well , you didn 't appreciate the <unk> of it until recently .
No question about that .
I was all of these .
... <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , sure .
You bring the cigarettes ?
I brought you some letters .
It 's really fan mail .
Women mostly .
One wants to buy you clothes , another sent a check .
Another wants a check .
I 'm <unk> rights - this man is <unk> by <unk> .
I 'm coming with him .
Yes .
Yes , come with me !
I 'm coming with you .
Where are we going ?
Don 't say anything .
He has the camera !
He took the movie !
Emil .
Take it easy .
Stay with me .
Sit down .
What do you need ?
What are you looking for ?
Oh no !
No !
Shit !
Here .
I have your money .
I 'm not your lawyer until I see the money .
Are you my attorney ?
I 'm Emil .
I 'm insane .
Daphne , I ...
I don 't want to drag you down with me .
... Do you really want me to forget about you ?
Forget about me .
You have enough problems of your own .
<unk> it out !
What are you doing ?
I 'll get my clothes .
I 'll make some for us .
In the kitchen .
Do you have coffee ?
Right .
You better get packed .
I 'm glad I met you .
No matter what happens ... I 'm glad I met you .
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process .
Eddie recommended one .
If you were my boyfriend , I 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn 't going to jail <unk> miles away .
If I was your boyfriend , I might be .
Ludwig ?
He 's gay - are you jealous ?
Is he your boyfriend ?
I 'm sorry .
I still can 't believe Eddie 's gone .
Are you alright ?
I 'm sorry .
I didn 't mean to ... I 'm glad .
Actually I 'm glad it 's over .
All this time .
<unk> .
Never being able to look anyone in the eyes .
Always afraid that someone would find out who I was .
Never trusting anyone ...
They 're not gonna send you right back .
You don 't know .
I 'm sorry .
I was desperate .
That 's not me .
I shot a cop .
Can you imagine what they 'll do to me when I got to prison ?
I know .
I 'm not a whore .
I 'm not a whore .
I 'm just trying to find out who you are .
What are you asking me ?
So you were never a prostitute ?
I came here .
I had no money .
I knew no one .
I couldn 't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work .
They <unk> me - I could 've made a lot of money .
I considered it , but ... it 's not who I am .
They pay me below the table at Ludwig 's .
No .
What about back home ?
No .
Did you ever turn tricks before ?
Yes , I considered it .
You considered becoming a prostitute ?
Yeah .
This way .
So ... the station is empty ?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out <unk> .
Somewhere else ?
I can 't take you to my place .
Do you live alone ?
I 've been in these clothes since ... the killings .
Could we stop at your place ?
I could take a shower ... before I go into custody ?
Divorced .
Are you married ?
They won 't until this is over .
I will if they don 't send me back .
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they 'll help you with your situation .
Now I become custody of police department ?
Yes , but he was a cop .
Alright .
That 's a <unk> homicide .
... my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was <unk> her .
His gun was on the chair ...
He came at me and I shot him .
You 're a cop - you 'll never believe me .
Look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here .
Tell us the truth ... is that the truth ?
I 'm from a small town in <unk> .
Like the <unk> here .
The Police is right , a civilian is wrong .
So I <unk> .
A cop ?
No , no , don 't talk to Immigration !
Are you here illegally ?
Don 't worry about that .
We 'll talk to Immigration .
They won 't <unk> you .
<unk> you for what ?
Why would we arrest you ?
If I tell you , will you arrest me ?
Whether you tell us or not , we 'll find out .
Better if it comes from you .
Go on .
Tamina was a friend of mine .
My shower was broken , she let me use theirs .
C 'mon , start at the beginning .
You know these people ?
I told your partner , I can 't help .
I didn 't see anything .
Yeah , sure .
<unk> me when you 're ready for the press conference .
I 'm ready to be <unk> .
Excuse us .
Oh yeah ... ?
Alright .
Look , after <unk> <unk> me , you can do the press conference .
How about that ?
The case is all yours .
Well , I 'm the <unk> Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I 'd like to be <unk> in decisions .
It was my decision , not his .
Oh .
There 's nothing to talk about .
Get a good lawyer .
You 're <unk> until your trial .
But Chief ?
Over this ? ?
How are you going to fight this ?
Maybe if Oleg hadn 't gotten away and you 'd been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight .
You 'd have the good to weight against the bad !
It 's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press <unk> but there 's nothing I can do !
Gimme your <unk> .
End my career ?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine .
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian .
<unk> ?
You <unk> a civilian to a tree ? !
What was I supposed to do ?
The guy tried to mug me .
I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot .
The public doesn 't have any idea what we do and now you 're going to <unk> our image !
This is going to be our <unk> King !
Okay .
But not water <unk> .
Chief - mind if I take her ?
Oh really .
That 's nice .
You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ?
Are you out of your fucking mind ? ?
Are you having that much trouble gettin ' dates ? !
No !
Nothing happened .
A shower ! ?
Did you take one , too ?
I let her take a shower .
What do you mean , ' cleaned up ? '
<unk> 20 was on the Rock for training .
We stopped there ... so she could get cleaned up .
I came to see how the investigation was going .
I called and you 're not here .
I wait up at the station and you don 't even show up ! ! !
I <unk> you - you don 't return my call .
Where the hell have you been ? !
Hey , Chief , what are you doing here ?
'Cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .
Then why didn 't you talk to the reporter ?
Who do you think , Chief ? !
Who did cause and origin ?
Yeah .
Alright .
<unk> by her apartment .
Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to <unk> Street .
You got that ?
Yeah .
He finished awhile ago .
Did the <unk>
videotape her deposition ?
You do that , <unk> .
Now let 's <unk> this thing before Eddie Flemming does .
I said , yeah , you 're right , Chief .
As soon as we get somethin ' we 'll let you alert the media .
What was that , Korfin ?
Yeah , right .
Don 't you guys understand ?
It 's all about image .
The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys <unk> .
I know .
Relax .
Take it easy .
Don 't worry , we 'll get those <unk> .
He got my gun !
<unk> was filming the whole time !
No .
I 'm okay .
Are you hit ?
Stay with her .
The other side of the street .
The guy with the videocamera .
Don 't look - put her in the car .
Stay this side .
C <unk> .
You wanna go to homicide school ?
Here - make yourself useful .
Yeah .
Only one guys checked in ?
It 's okay .
Sorry ... <unk> only .
Still unknown but we 're running <unk> .
<unk> over there caught the case .
Any I.D. ?
<unk> ' a <unk> .
Where is she ?
A timer .
What 's he looking for ?
You ready ?
Tomorrow .
At lunch .
When ?
I 'm gonna propose .
What 's the kid gonna say - sorry ?
Meanwhile I 'm not here anymore .
Like last week - we were at the <unk> and this guy was all chopped up - <unk> here - liver there - his heart in a <unk> .
Six hours ago this guy was walkin ' his dog or <unk> ' a <unk> of milk .
Who knows ?
But some kid 's robbed him for $ <unk> or some shit and shot him and now you can 't tell if he 's a piece of <unk> or a human being and I 'm thinkin ' that 's me .
Sooner or later .
That 's me .
It was <unk> , I 'll tell you .
<unk> kid .
Maybe you could just put in a shot of <unk> ?
Vodka tonic .
Coffee for me , I gotta slow down .
She <unk> hair up at Ludwig 's - a salon on 63rd and Madison .
He had a videocamera ?
Where is she ?
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> , scary eyes .
Second guy with him was ... shorter , with a <unk> 's build .
And he wouldn 't turn his videocamera off me .
<unk> him .
He said he was her cousin .
I told him where she works .
They were just here .
Daphne .
Another guy came in asking me about her , too .
What are you saying ?
<unk> , she 's so popular all the sudden .
Did you tell him you did ?
No .
Do you have any Czech girls working for you ?
Yeah .
He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia , but I sent him Honey ' cause once they get there , you know , it doesn 't really matter - Honey was killed ... ?
Poor girl ... Oh my G-d . Honey !
Honey 's dead ?
We don 't have her I.D.
yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the King <unk> Hotel .
What 's wrong ?
<unk> , Miss <unk> .
It 's Detective Eddie Flemming .
Open up .
I have nothin ' to say .
If you wanna contact my attorney ... Police .
We 'd like to ask you a few questions .
Who 's there ?
You know , I don 't know .
I like you .
You remind me of a puppy I used to have .
He pissed on the <unk> all the time , but I still kept him .
Why 'd you help me back there with the Chief ?
Why 'd you stand up for me like that ?
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer .
Here , here 's a number of an Immigration lawyer .
That 's how you help her .
But you can 't get involved in her like that .
You 're gonna jeopardize your career , your life and you 're gonna jeopardize my case .
And lemme give you another piece of advice .
Maybe you don 't watch TV but I 'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin ' world <unk> television .
And when you get out there , they know your face .
And the little fame , the little fuckin ' <unk> <unk> fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job .
And I get more done because of it .
But , I mean , didn 't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ?
I mean , you shoulda heard her there .
<unk> ' her whole story ... I believed her .
Well , it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not .
Don 't you understand , that 's why you 're a professional .
I told you , you know , I thought I was doing the right thing , you know , I think she 's innocent .
No , I don 't think you were a fool , I just think you were stupid about it .
I mean , to say the least , you outta know better .
You don 't know her well enough .
She 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she <unk> that you made a pass at her , it 's fuckin ' over .
You can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference .
You 're dead .
Yeah , just her in the shower .
Nothing happened .
Look , I 'm sure you probably think I 'm a fool and I fucked up , but ... Just a shower ?
I took her there for a shower and that 's it .
Well , you shoulda because nobody 's gonna believe you didn 't ... <unk> me .
Look , Eddie , I 'm tellin ' you - I didn 't touch her .
Women like that have a way of turning <unk> into <unk> .
Hey .
I 'm a professional .
Okay , tell you what , I 'll give you a head start .
You take her to the station house .
Don 't let her out of your sight .
She 's the only warm body we got left .
You know what I 'm saying here .
You 're her <unk> ?
Is she the kid you 're gonna save from the burning building ?
C 'mon .
You <unk> her ' cause you 're a celebrity .
She sees me differently .
So am I. I 'm serious here .
My point exactly .
I don 't have a girlfriend .
What would your girlfriend think of that ?
Yeah .
You wanna talk to her alone ?
Look - let me talk to her .
Any <unk> I get , they 're all yours .
Just let me have a first crack at her .
Raw deal .
She 's fucked .
Even if that story is true .
Something back home ?
Why not ?
Is that all there is ?
She just saw two of her friends killed !
They probably threatened her .
What are you hiding ?
Why are you afraid Then I guess we 're doin ' this the right way , aren 't we ?
If we pull up to a burning building I 'll <unk> let you go first .
I wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
Hey !
I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid .
I <unk> of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling ' <unk> ! '
at the bad guy !
What 'd you dream about ?
Of course .
So am I. Alright , I 'll go inside and you cover the back .
I 'm on duty .
You <unk> ?
I 'm on my way with Eddie .
Ludwig 's .
63rd and Madison .
The <unk> might be there already .
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison .
<unk> salon .
Ludwig 's .
Better than one .
Two heads .
I 'll call it ... <unk> .
Tell you what - I 'll <unk> you a <unk> .
If you win you can come with me .
If you don 't win , you don 't come .
This is ridiculous .
I 'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over .
I 'll let you know what happens .
But what if it does ?
You might need my help .
This has nothing to do with your fire .
Mind if I ride along with you ?
You got any better ideas ?
You goin ' to the escort service ?
Stay here .
My folks are .
You 're <unk> ?
My parents are from <unk> .
I can help with the Eastern European angle .
This isn 't homicide school .
I can watch you , Eddie .
Maybe I 'll learn something .
There wasn 't a fire .
There 'll be nothing for you to do .
I 'll come with you .
Or Czechoslovakia .
The <unk> have been fighting the <unk> and the <unk> for a thousand years .
These are very intense people and they take things personally .
Eastern Europe .
Like what ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
Maybe it 's a <unk> thing or someone trying to send a message .
<unk> <unk> are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe .
It could be to <unk> them .
Just burning them up , no proper funeral , it 's like <unk> them to hell .
Look , I 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this .
I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead .
Maybe she saw something .
Maybe she was <unk> somebody here .
Who knows ?
What would you call her ?
Who says she 's a suspect ?
Maybe you don 't care about that either .
<unk> suspect I 've had in awhile .
Hmmmm .
Pretty .
The <unk> said he 'd seen her before but she didn 't live here .
You were right , they were both dead before the fire .
The male was <unk> so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine .
That 's usually an indicator of something personal .
If you found me steppin ' on your crime scene - it might piss you off , too .
What about the report ?
Sure .
But I would like to ask you something .
You got a problem with me ?
Did you get a report from the <unk> ?
Good .
Good .
<unk> .
I don 't even watch TV .
Nah , why should you ?
Well , just so you know , I don 't care about that stuff .
Well , just so you know .
I gave you guys the credit .
Nah , I musta missed it .
Watch the news ?
It 's your crime scene now .
You can do what you want .
Why don 't you explain it , Bobby .
Hey <unk> !
You mind <unk> a hole in the floor ?
No , what is it ?
You know what that is , right ?
No , we don 't mind .
You mind Leon ?
Hey , that 's great you guys got it all <unk> up , but you don 't mind if we go through the routine ?
It gives us somethin ' to do .
<unk> than Americans .
You 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long .
Not only will Americans believe me , they 'll cry for me .
So ... Detective Eddie Flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your <unk> ?
Maybe you can propose to her now ?
You really think you 'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ?
How fuckin ' stupid are you ?
If you kill me and film it you 're putting a <unk> around your neck .
So tabloids don 't have to do re <unk> .
They going to have real movie this time .
Good - be tough to the end .
<unk> who plays you will want to die like hero .
Then do it , asshole .
I kill someone famous .
What 's your <unk> .
Your opinion .
You see , they going to make a movie about me , too , Eddie .
And write books .
What do you want ?
So ... who 's <unk> ?
Don 't be late .
Thank you .
See you later .
Good luck .
Okay .
Yeah , yeah .
Good thing .
Okay .
And you know what , I 'll <unk> by my place , grab a couple <unk> of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours ... How 's that ... Would that be a good thing .
Yeah .
I promise .
You promise ?
Tonight .
Okay , til tonight .
I love you .
<unk> you ... <unk> , I love you .
Yeah .
I 'll do that .
As long as you 're not patronizing me .
I promise .
We 'll talk .
You 'll be great .
You 'll be fine .
Go ahead , just imagine that , uh ... Just look into the <unk> and imagine you 're talking to me .
Promise ?
I 'll tell you tonight .
Let 's do it tonight .
As soon as you get back we 'll talk .
We 'll talk .
No .
No , listen to me here .
I want to know what you 're talking about .
You know , the <unk> thing and the marriages and ... No .
Go ahead .
You 're gonna be great .
Okay .

But I can 't go now , we 're in the middle of something here .
Well , that 's great .
Yeah .
That 's good .
Oh my G-d , they want me to anchor .

Hold that thought just for a second .
They only call me when it 's an emergency .
Just hold that thought .
Can you call back ?
Answer it .
No .
Tell me what you want to say .
Answer the phone .
Don 't worry about the damn phone .
I won 't answer it .

What am I going to do with you ?
Could be Leon 's .
Look at this .
You have blood on your shirt .
Whose is it ?
You 're not so bad yourself .
You 're <unk> .
Well , who was it that taught me how to do that ?
Huh ?
You were <unk> .
You didn 't give a shit if you got me or not .
That was good .
You were holding the evidence .
Yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence .
That was ...
Yes you are .
I 'm not just some reporter .
I don 't just stick a <unk> in your face .
You could give me something .
I 'm not .
Alright , alright , Eddie .
Don 't <unk> me .
Maybe I should just , ya know ... turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?
Stop it .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
Did I embarrass you , sweetheart ?
Oh ... You didn 't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .
You could give me something .
I can 't ... I can 't answer you just because you want me to answer you !
What is your problem ?
Why 'd you snap at me ?
I just wanted a statement .
Hey .
Hey , honey .
Okay .
Alright .

Detective Jackson 's hurt .
He 's fine .
I 've got a Fire Marshall shot , Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously .
Do you have the suspect in custody ?
He was hurt , but not seriously .
He 'll be fine .
Okay .
But I do understand that your partner , Leon Jackson 's been injured .
Is that correct ?
I really can 't give out any information right now at this point .
I understand , but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you .
Is this somehow related to the fire department ?
I can 't talk right now .
We have some things to take care of .
Detective - can you tell us what happened here ?
We don 't know .
When I have more I 'll let you know .
Is it drug related ?
You know you can 't do that .
C 'mon .
Can we go up to the crime scene ?
There are two bodies found at this point .
How many <unk> are up there ?
We don 't know that yet .
It 's much too early .
There 's a lot to be done .
Detective , does it look like a murder ?
Again ?
I didn 't wanna do it the first time .
Any chance we can do that again ?
Yeah , yeah .
Jesus .
Okay .
You ready ?
Keep them out of my way .
Ready ?
You 're worried for my safety .
I 'm touched .
I hope this <unk> doesn 't run .

Right where I was standin ' .
That coulda been it .
I coulda had my head blown off and for what ?
