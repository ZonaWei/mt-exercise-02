A whole new world , new kids to play with .
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury , Dad ?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury .
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us .
We 'll have to check , Jimmy .
It 's a pretty long trip to Mercury .
Will Scraps be able to sit with us , Dad ?
Do you like it when Scraps <unk> on his back , Jimmy ?
Yeah .
He 's a boy dog .
Sure .
Can I hold him ?
Scraps .
Come on up , Jimmy .
Say , that 's some puppy .
What 's his name ?
What ... ?
All right .
Here .
Okay , Joey .
The Doc says you gotta relax .
This hospital in <unk> <unk> is the best sex <unk> in the country .
I don 't want to hear that word !
Joey , what 's more important , the kids ' clothes or your <unk> <unk> .
We 've spent everything on these operations .
Is it really worth it ?
We 've <unk> your mother 's wedding ring .
The kids have no winter clothes ... Take this , Joey .
It 's my last few bucks .
You 'll need a hot meal when you get there .
I 'm sure .
You 're sure ?
That 's right , Joe .
Now , no one 's going to hurt you and no one has to know what 's wrong with you .
What ?
Joe , the insurance policy won 't help your wife and kids .
You bought <unk> insurance , not life insurance .
I don 't want to live anymore .
Joe , you don 't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people .
Have you tried it with a little <unk> ?
Captain , the coffee machine is jammed and I don 't like it .
Poached !
Not over !
Over !
All right , Captain Oveur .
Over .
That 's how I want them .
Poached .
Over .
Just <unk> on toast .
Over .
Poached < u > and < / u > over , Captain Oveur ?
Over .
No .
Poached .
Over .
How would you like your eggs , Captain ?
Over .
A couple eggs and <unk> would be nice , Mary .
Over .
Anything .
Just don 't let Salucci think we 're onto him .
What should I say ?
No , a bomb .
Now , as <unk> as possible , I want you to move the passengers into the <unk> .
A <unk> ...
He 's carrying a bomb .
<unk> ' C ' , why ?
Which <unk> is Joe Salucci ?
Yes , sir , <unk> .
This is Mercury One .
Everything seems <unk> okay up here and ready for <unk> .
Whenever your 're ready , Captain .
Captain Oveur , your navigator , Mr. Unger , and your first officer , Mr. Dunn .
Good to be aboard , gentlemen .
Do you think it 's necessary to explain < u > everything < / u > ?
That 's how dry cleaning works .
Now I 'd like to quickly go over the <unk> system of <unk> .
We don 't have much time .
Let 's move .
I 'll explain everything .
Mr. Kurtz , I presume .
Captain Oveur ?
Now he 's <unk> and wants to be buried on Mercury .
Ah , yes , the Institute , I 'm familiar with it .
Let 's go , Daddy .
We have to check in .
He was never <unk> at the Institute .
It 's a privilege to meet you , sir , I 'm familiar with all your work .
Yes .
Say , isn 't that Dr. Barrington , the <unk> renowned agronomist ?
Thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on <unk> .
You folks need any help ?
But that 's not a door .
The door 's over there .
Don 't try to stop me !
You can 't go in there !
Death , death .
How about the first Thursday in March , ten o 'clock .
All right , it 's a matter of death .
You 'll have to be more specific than that , sir .
No , dammit .
It 's a matter of life or death .
Do you have an appointment , sir ?
I have to see Bud Kruger .
Pull yourself together !
We 've got to ... Don 't talk to me about Elaine .
<unk> my way !
Then Elaine was right .
That damn computer has taken over .
I 'm getting out .
Kurtz , you 're drunk .
Who 's in command of this ship ?
Striker .
I know you 've been <unk> <unk> the word that I 'm having a <unk> .
You 're tired , Striker , overworked .
That wiring <unk> all the safety specifications .
Look at this wiring .
It 's <unk> out under high <unk> .
You 're seeing <unk> where they don 't exist , Striker .
That 's right , Striker .
And we 're getting married when we return .
Are you on the Mercury mission ?
Well , we laughed .
We laughed all the time .
No .
It 's hard to <unk> when your father 's dying .
I just wish it was that simple .
We really were in love .
You know how it is when you laugh all the time .
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there 's change in the two people who share that love .
Sure .
But that 's only when the love itself goes <unk> .
Not if the people change together in relation to that love .
People change in relation to each other .
Love changes on its own .
Love 's the same as it always was .
It 's people who change .
We were in love but I 'm not sure I know what love is anymore .
No .
I mean your relationship .
I <unk> this panel and a <unk> <unk> hit me .
Do you want to talk about it .
No , I mean your head .
Sit down .
I 'll take a look at it .
I 'm a nurse .
I 'm getting over it .
If a relationship isn 't working , you can 't force it .
You 've been hurt .
You don 't have to excuse yourself .
I 'm a nurse .
I understand .
I 'm familiar with your work , Doctor .
You 'll have to excuse me , I have to go .
Yes .
He 's dying < u > <unk> < / u > wants to be buried on Mercury .
Not Dr. Barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
You don 't have to thank me , I 'm a nurse .
This is my father , Dr. Barrington .
Uh ... oh , thank you .
It 's nothing .
Excuse me , are you alright ?
I noticed you talking to yourself .
I 'm a nurse .
Can I be of some help ?
That 's a very nice compliment , and I 'd like to say that ... you 've done the same for me .
Just in case I don 't have a chance to say goodbye , I want you to know that I haven 't spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
No .
I 'm all alone .
I 'm sure we 'll both make it ... but just in case one of us ... well , is there a message you 'd like me to give someone ?
That 's a lovely name .
Mine 's <unk> ... <unk> <unk> .
But my friends call me ' <unk> . '
Mine 's Eleanor .
Eleanor <unk> .
You know , here we are having coffee together , and <unk> education and business and <unk> ... and we don 't even know each other 's names ... full names I mean .
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that 's the reason .
The truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .
I know the answer -- <unk> .
A smart woman like you became so involved in your work , you didn 't have time for marriage .
Well , I 'm afraid that 's a question that 's all too easy to answer .
But I think it 's time we stopped talking about me .
A woman like you -- why haven 't you ever married ?
Well , after a thing like that you wouldn 't be expected to .
After my wife died , I felt like a fifth wheel .
You know , so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a <unk> ... When Ethel passed away , I was lost .
I couldn 't function <unk> and I couldn 't function in business .
No .
I 'm from Washington , D.C.
I 'm a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> 's <unk> .
Well , it really wasn 't a vacation .
You see , I 'm a teacher in the New York City school system , and I was <unk> a <unk> on <unk> <unk> to education .
Are you from L.A. ?
Were you <unk> in Los Angeles ?
No , thank you .
I take it black .
Like my men .
Thank you .
Cream ?
Ah , won 't you sit down ?
That 's very nice of you .
Thank you .
I happened to be passing , and I thought you might like some <unk> .
Shep , no !
He gets so excited when new people are here .
... but after ... awhile ... you begin to ... ... get used to it .
Shep , no !
I 'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there .
Yeah , something like that , but as I say , they didn 't have time to tell me very much .
Something about a plane with no pilot ?
Well , to tell the truth , they really didn 't fill me in on many of the details .
Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer .
Shep , sit ... sit !
So , I understand you 've got a real emergency down there .
Oh , yes .
Come in , Paul .
<unk> will be right out .
Hello , I 'm Paul <unk> from the airline .
I 'm here to pick up Captain Kramer .
Excuse me , Doc , I 've got a plane to land .
And the last thing he said to me , " Doc , " he said , " <unk> when the crew is up against it and the breaks are <unk> the boys , tell them to go out there with all they 've got and win just one for the <unk> .
I don 't know where I 'll be then , Doc , " he said , " but I won 't smell too good .
That 's for sure . "
George Zipp said that ?
I 'm doing everything I can !
-- And stop calling me Shirley !
Surely there must be something you can do .
I won 't <unk> you , Mister Striker .
We 're running out of time .
Yes , everything they 've got .
How are the passengers doing ?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport ?
Chicago , the passengers are beginning to <unk> .
When do we start down ?
... safe and sound and free to <unk> a life of religious <unk> .
Let 's see .
Those are the <unk> , that 's the <unk> , this must turn on the landing lights .
Elaine , I haven 't time to put this gently , so I 'll be very direct .
Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation .
Mister Striker is the only hope we 've got .
Well , I flew <unk> fighters in the Air Force , but this plane has four engines .
It 's an entirely different kind of flying ... < u > all < / u > < u > together < / u > ! ! !
I < u > am < / u > serious , and don 't call me Shirley !
What flying experience have you had ?
Surely you can 't be serious .
Can you fly this airplane and land it ?
Both pilots !
I 'm not sure .
I haven 't seen anything like this since the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is it , Doctor ?
What 's happening ?
No , I mean we can 't < u > land < / u > for another two hours .
<unk> has closed down everything this side of the <unk> .
We 've got to go through to Chicago !
You can 't take a guess for another two hours ?
Well ... not for another two hours .
Can 't you take a guess ?
I can 't tell .
Captain , how soon can we land ?
I think you ought to know what our chances are .
The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing : finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane , but who didn 't have fish for dinner .
No .
No one that I know of .
Well ... All right .
Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly , I can 't even be sure of saving their lives .
Now , is there anyone else on board who can land this plane ?
No .
Elaine , you 're a member of this crew .
Can you face some unpleasant facts ?
Extremely serious .
It starts with a <unk> <unk> .
Just how serious is it , doctor ?
He had fish , too .
Let 's see now .
The co-pilot had fish .
What did the navigator eat ?
Doctor Rumack , Mister <unk> ate fish .
And Randy says there are five more cases , and they ate fish , too .
He had fish .
What did he have ?
Yes , yes , I remember .
I had <unk> .
Well , we had a choice .
<unk> or fish .
What was it we had for dinner tonight ?
Certainly .
It 's a big building with <unk> .
But that 's not important right now .
Tell the Captain I must speak to him .
A hospital ?
What is it ?
You 'd better tell the Captain .
We 've got to land as soon as we can .
This woman has to be gotten to a hospital .
Yes .
Yes , of course .
We have some passengers who are very sick .
Could you come and take a look at them ?
That 's right .
Sir .
Excuse me , sir .
I 'm sorry to have to wake you .
Are you a doctor ?
<unk> .
See them , Elaine ?
The gear is down .
Tell them the gear is down and we 're ready to land .
I wanted you to know -- now -- I 'm very proud .
Yes ?
Ted ...
I don 't care .
I just don 't have what it takes .
They 'd be better off with someone who 'd never flown before .
But Ted , you 're the only ... <unk> pressure .
I forgot to check the oil pressure .
When Kramer hears about this , the shit 's gonna hit the fan .
What happened , Ted ?
What went wrong ?
<unk> !
I 've lost number three .
It 's a damn good thing you don 't know how much he hates your guts .
It 's a damn good thing he doesn 't know how much I hate his guts .
Sluggish .
Like a wet sponge .
Sluggish .
Like a wet sponge .
And a little ice !
And a little ice .
Rain .
That 's what I 've been trying to tell these people .
Ted !
What are you doing ?
You can 't fly this plane !
A lot of people made plans before the war .
Like George Zipp .
Ted , I don 't want to stay here .
It 's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war .
I think they 're getting the hang of it !
When we <unk> I 'll teach them <unk> !
That 's <unk> <unk> .
<unk> shell shock .
He thinks he 's Ethel <unk> .
What 's his problem ?
Be patient , Ted .
No one expects you to get over this immediately .
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp .
Seven .
Lieutenant Zipp died this morning .
Ted , Doctor <unk> says you 'll be out in a week .
Isn 't that wonderful ?
Is it ?
Because of my mistake six men didn 't return from that raid .
It 's a big building where the <unk> meet .
But that 's not important right now .
They 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid .
Isn 't that good news ?
<unk> ! ?
What is it ?
You got a <unk> from headquarters today .
But it won 't be .
Not as long as you insist on living in the past !
That 's the way I 've always wanted it to be , Elaine .
Mostly I remember ... the nights when we were together .
I remember how you used to hold me ... and how I used to sit on your face and <unk> ... and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up .
When it did , it was almost like ... like each new day was created ... only for us .
I remember everything .
All I have are memories .
Elaine , just hear me out .
I know things haven 't been right for a long time .
But it will be different ... like it was in the beginning .
Remember ?
I love you .
I love you , Elaine .
Oh , Ted , please be careful .
I worry about you so much .
My orders came through .
My <unk> ships out tomorrow .
I 'll be <unk> a very important mission .
What 's the matter ?
You ... you shouldn 't have come .
I don 't have time now .
Elaine , I 've got to talk to you .
Ted , what are you doing here ?
It 's too late , Ted .
When I get back to Chicago , I 'm going to start my life all over again .
I 'm sorry .
But if you 'll just give me ...
It 's the truth .
What 's hurt you the most is your record since the war .
Different <unk> , different jobs , and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
You expect me to believe that ?
Your < u > war < / u > < u > record < / u > ?
You 're the only one keeping that alive .
For everyone else it 's ancient history .
You know I haven 't been able to get near an airplane since the war .
And even if I could , they wouldn 't hire me because of my war record .
Then why don 't you take the job that <unk> <unk> offered you at Boeing ?
Elaine , not yet .
I promise you I really can change .
I won 't be back .
I 've requested the <unk> run .
Look , you 'll be back in town tomorrow night .
We 'll have dinner -- talk it over .
It takes so many things to make love last .
Most of all it takes respect .
And I can 't live with a man I don 't respect !
Don 't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
I have been patient and I 've tried to help , but you wouldn 't even let me do that .
I know things haven 't been right for a long time , but it 'll be different .
If you 'll just be patient , I can work things out .
I just don 't want to go over it any more .
I came home early and found your note .
I guess you meant for me to read it later .
Elaine , I 've got to talk to you .
Ted !
Elaine !
Find out if there 's a doctor on board , as <unk> as you can .
I think so , but I 've never seen it so <unk> .
<unk> ?
Who wants to be first ?
Hey , we 've been waiting for you .
A little bit late tonight .
Joey can stay up here for a while if he 'd like to .
We 'd better get back now .
Hello .
We have a visitor .
Good-bye , darling .
Good-bye , darling .
I love you .
I love you , darling .
Good-bye , darling .
Bill !
Bill !
Good-bye , Bill .
So long , darling .
Good-bye .
Take care of yourself .
Oh , Bill , I 'll keep it .
I 'll keep it with me all the time .
Good-bye , darling .
Every day .
You promise you 'll write .
Oh , Bill , I 'm going to miss you so much .
All right , he 's on final now !
Put out all runway lights except niner .
He 's right on the heading .
Watch your altitude , Striker .
It 's too erratic .
You can 't come straight in .
You 've got enough fuel left for two hours flying .
You 've got to stay up there ' til we get a break in the weather .
He 's all over the place !
Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet !
What an asshole !
You are now eight miles from the airport .
Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner , <unk> back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet .
Eight miles .
Turn right to heading zero eight niner .
<unk> niner .
It 's the longest , and <unk> into the wind .
Did you decide on a runway yet ?
Yes , Captain ?
And get that finger out of your ear .
You don 't know where that finger 's been !
<unk> ?
Here .
Oh Jack , I 'm so warm .
I 'm burning up .
How ya doing , honey ?
What is it ?
Oh , I can 't stand it .
Well , it wasn 't all that I had hoped .
What did you think of ' Great <unk> ? '
Yeah , I think he is .
Hey , Fred !
Jack , isn 't that Fred <unk> over there in the blue <unk> ?
Maybe he 's on our flight to Chicago .
The hell I don 't !
I 'm out there busting my <unk> every night .
... and that you don 't really try , except during the <unk> .
We are turning left to a heading of <unk> niner-niner .
... and that lots of times you don 't even run down <unk> .
<unk> Control , this is Flight <unk> niner <unk> Victor <unk> <unk> niner-niner .
I think you 're the greatest .
But my Dad says you don 't work hard enough on <unk> .
I 'm an airline pilot .
Ah , Clarence , according to my calculations , with this <unk> we ought to be able to make up an <unk> fifteen minutes over the <unk> .
I think you should go back to your seat now , Joey .
Right , Clarence ?
You < u > are < / u > Kareem .
I 've seen you play .
My Dad 's got season tickets !
I 'm sorry , son , but you must have me confused with someone else .
My name is Roger Murdock .
I 'm the co-pilot .
Wait a minute .
I know you .
You 're Kareem <unk> <unk> .
You play <unk> for the Los Angeles <unk> !
Okay , this is one of my favorites .
Oh , I 'd love to .
I thought maybe you 'd like to hear a song .
I 'm Lisa .
Oh , you have a guitar !
I 'm Randy .
Hi !
Oh , it 's nothing to be <unk> about .
We 'll get back to you very quickly .
Yes , of course .
We both had fish .
Why ?
Well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment .
One thing : do you know what he had for dinner ?
Oh , <unk> .
My husband is very sick .
Can you do something , please ?
Yes ?
I will , but Jim won 't .
Would either of you like another <unk> of coffee ?
All right .
But just remember , my name is Roger Murdock .
No , he 's not bothering anyone .
Let him stay up here .
No , why don 't you take care <unk> it ?
Do you want me to check the weather , Clarence ?
Roger , Roger .
What 's our <unk> , Victor ?
We have <unk> , Clarence .
Huh ?
Roger .
Huh ?
Roger .
Hi , Roger .
Good to have you aboard .
Victor , this is Roger Murdock .
Sorry , Clarence .
<unk> weather report shows everything <unk> in from <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
Of course .
Could I borrow your guitar ?
I thought I might be able to cheer her up .
Oh yes , I saw .
Poor child .
There 's a little girl on board who 's ill and ...
Yes ?
Excuse me , Sister ?
Thank you , Randy .
You better leave sweetheart .
You might get hurt in here .
Mr. Striker , the passengers are ready .
Would you go up , please ?
Well , I flew in the war , but that was a long time ago .
I wouldn 't know anything about it .
It 's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit .
But that 's not important right now .
The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio .
Do you know anything about planes ?
The cockpit ?
What is it ?
Excuse me , sir .
There 's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering ... No .
No thank you .
Excuse me , sir .
Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner ?
Oh -- I haven 't flown for a long time .
Do you feel all right , sir ?
Thank you .
<unk> .
It 's <unk> down on your right .
Yeah ... You okay ?
Your voice is saying no , but your body is saying yes .
I like my horizons narrow .
I think you 're just a little scared now , about what you might find once the lights go out .
A little scared ... and a lot curious .
Maybe more than you want to admit .
But doesn 't that turn you on , that <unk> and fear , <unk> together ?
Think of it as <unk> your horizons .
There 's lots of things I haven 't done , but his ain 't high on the list .
Don 't take it personally .
A <unk> .
I find that very <unk> ... Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later .
I know ... Why don 't you hang around for a while , let me <unk> you ?
It 's Matt , right ?
Now tell me the truth , have you ever ... made it ... with one of us ?
Todd ?
Todd doesn 't know either .
The girl out front mentioned Strader 's assistant , somebody named Watson .
Maybe he knows .
Look , I don 't know where Mr. Strader might be .
He comes and he goes .
You 've got me all wrong .
I don 't charge money for something that I myself find <unk> ...
Does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
Oooh .
<unk> .
That sounds interesting .
Are you going to strike me ?
You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me ...
I 've got my own <unk> .
Show me .
In there .
She did , did she ?
Well , she was wrong .
Excuse me , I have to change .
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is .
He 's not here .
Why ask me ?
Ss 'ai k 'ss ?
Perfect .
We are with the Police Department .
This is Sergeant Sykes , and I <unk> That 's right .
You are <unk> ?
I may be an asshole , but at least I 'm a real detective , not some <unk> shit space thing .
Lay off , asshole .
Well , if it isn 't Detective Jetson .
Forget you hip <unk> , big guy ?
I 'd like to see you next to a sea of <unk> acid , Fedorchuk ... see how much <unk> ' you 'd do .
Look at your <unk> partner .
He 's too scared to even come down to the <unk> .
You 're not gonna get wet standing here , moron !
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown ?
The list of Newcomer <unk> is about as long as the list of <unk> war heroes ... You don 't have <unk> .
Jesus , Sykes -- it 's been less than ten hours .
Me and Alterez are on it , okay ?
So what 've you got on Tuggle 's killers ?
No , Sergeant -- not history ... Eternity ... Move a finger , Harcourt , and you 're history ... That 's right .
He and I , along with seven or eight others .
Listen , gentlemen , I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately , at the moment , I 'm overdue at another function .
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh , Newcomer real estate thing .
Yes , I heard about poor Warren .
<unk> .
Sergeant ... Detective .
I wasn 't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet .
I 'm Sergeant Sykes , and this is Detective Jetson , Los Angeles Police Department .
Yes ... William Harcourt ?
Do it !
Here ?
Kill them both .
This is getting out of hand .
I want you to deal with it .
Immediately .
When we picked him up , he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley .
It is his new partner that I 'm worried about .
He didn 't recognize me .
This is becoming a serious <unk> of security .
That cop , the human , he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver .
You look very good .
How do I look ?
You understand that .
But how many others will ?
But there 's no more drug .
Because ... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming .
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up ?
We can 't let him get away .
I never thought I 'd say this , but -- for once in my life I think I 'm willing to wait for back-up .
Tell me about it ... No he 's not .
Not if he <unk> on the drug .
<unk> amounts trigger a ... a change .
Your body functions <unk> up , you appear to be dead , but it 's really a state of <unk> .
When you <unk> you 're ... Harcourt is dead .
...
It 's Harcourt .
What is this ? !
Do what ? !
<unk> ?
!
No !
We must do this alone .
There !
Go back .
Down that side street .
What 's this about , George ?
I know that look .
It 'd be for your own good .
I think you 'd be better off with a partner who 's a little more ... by the book .
...
Still , I gotta tell you , George , for a quiet guy , you 're sure hell on wheels once you get going .
I 'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective .
With Harcourt and Kipling dead , I assume you will be <unk> <unk> now .
<unk> !
Shit !
Fuck procedure .
Why ?
What 's the big goddamn deal ?
The fifty <unk> , Matthew .
I have to find it .
I can 't let it get out on the street .
George , c 'mon -- <unk> up .
It 's a beauty of a case .
Don 't sweat it -- we got him by the short <unk> .
He ain 't gonna make any more of the shit .
Stay out of this , Matthew .
Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will <unk> your lungs against this wall .
George , uh ... you 're gonna break his little chest bones ... Where is the drug ?
Where have they taken it ?
Uh , George ... No , George -- you 're missing the point .
The drug is evidence .
We need to have the evidence , ya know ?
If the drug is here , we must destroy it .
Okay , George -- we gotta play this real smart .
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together .
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan .
Porter , with his <unk> background , must have somehow come up with the <unk> for the drug .
Hubley <unk> it -- at the refinery .
Strader , through the nightclub , <unk> a <unk> network .
And <unk> I must trust you , Matthew .
I cannot stop this without you .
George ... look me in the eye ... George , you don 't ever lie to me again .
Your people don 't know about this part of out past .
And they can 't know -- It would threaten our entire <unk> here .
Jesus , this is major .
Why didn 't you tell me sooner ?
Why 'd you hold out on me ?
No ...
I am sure not .
That is why I am so concerned ... someone must now be <unk> it here .
But none of my people know how to make it .
The process was carefully guarded .
Where did he get it ?
Was there any of it on the ship ?
We all did .
We ?
You 've taken it ?
Like your <unk> , I suppose .
The " high " <unk> several hours .
We would receive small amounts of it ... as a <unk> for our <unk> .
How potent ?
...
It is called ss <unk> ' .
To us it is a potent <unk> .
The hell it isn 't , when somebody wires up enough <unk> <unk> to my car to turn me into pink <unk> !
That Slag was on something , and not <unk> milk , either ?
Am I right ?
<unk> <unk> !
What is it ?
No .
I cannot <unk> you .
This is not your concern .
No secrets , <unk> !
You don 't hold back from me .
Whatever is going on , you 're gonna tell me now !
You must leave me alone on this .
What 's this nothing shit ?
It wasn 't nothing yesterday when you asked <unk> to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit <unk> <unk> , and it 's not nothing now .
Don 't lie to me , George , you 're bad at it .
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart .
So what the hell 's the connection ?
Warren Hubley was in middle <unk> at a refinery ... Joshua Strader <unk> a successful bar and nightclub ... ...
So we 've got three guys dead .
All Newcomers , all killed the same way -- execution style .
Nothing .
What was that about ?
Thank you .
It 's all right , George .
It 's cool .
Just wait here , all right ?
I 'll be back in a coupla minutes .
Stop the car !
Come on , you won 't have to get near the water .
Please , I must get out here .
Why ?
Stop the car .
Come on , let 's go , dude .
Surf 's up !
To the ... to the <unk> ?
Well , let 's roll , George .
She 's very <unk> .
I 'm certain she 's considering it .
George , she 's not gonna divorce you .
You mate for life , remember ?
She 's going to divorce me .
A man , a human , was wiring it to your car .
I didn 't get a good look at him .
I must call my wife ... Where 'd you get this ? ! !
Yeah , go home .
Get some sleep .
You do sleep , don 't you ?
I 'm going home .
Don 't count on me , George .
I never had any ideals .
I hope you can understand how special your world is ... how unique a people you humans are .
So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves .
You humans are very curious to us .
You invite us to live among you , in an atmosphere of equality we 've never known before .
You lay before us a beautiful green world , full of <unk> and opportunities ... You give us <unk> of our lives for the first time ... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves : to live by the rules ... rules that aren 't made to keep one people <unk> to another , but rules that exist to preserve equality .
You <unk> to very high ideals here .
No shit , Holmes .
You 're only from another goddamn planet , for <unk> .
There is so much our two <unk> don 't understand about each other .
<unk> ss <unk> ' ...
Your <unk> ... <unk> out of his ass ... yeah !
See , that 's what makes it a joke .
There 's like a surprise , and your mind <unk> in the funny picture .
Here 's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it 's a thermometer .
<unk> , huh ?
In the other man 's <unk> .
... and so , and so the doctor says , " If this is the thermometer , then where 'd I leave the pen ? "
You 're not ... you don 't think that 's funny ?
George , work with me , I always get a laugh with that one .
Look , if the doctor 's got the thermometer in his hand , then where 's his pen gotta be ?
Maybe not ...
I don 't know .
I 'm not sure I 'm gonna go .
She doesn 't need her <unk> of a father there ... Human children can be very beautiful .
<unk> married ?
Congratulations .
You will be taking Sunday off , then ...
I appreciate your <unk> , George .
Your home is quite <unk> .
I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in .
It 's like having an <unk> finger <unk> .
It hurts like hell , but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place .
We mate for life .
<unk> ... is a strange <unk> to us .
Was .
Divorced .
You are married ?
Yeah ...
I know the routine .
My wife ?
She worries about me .
So , she keeps you on a pretty short <unk> , does she ?
Through his ass .
Next time you see him , tell him to call me ... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of <unk> .
I believe he is probably lying .
When will Strader return ?
We were chasing you because you ran , you dumb <unk> .
Todd Watson .
The assistant manager .
Who is he ?
Yeah , that 's it .
Say it slow .
Ss <unk> ss <unk> ' <unk> ' .
And what was that one about my mother ?
That was a good one .
Ss <unk> ' .
It means literally " small but intelligent creature " .
It <unk> much in the <unk> .
So what was that other word for Human ...
Slow <unk> ?
Our bodies do not <unk> the <unk> if the food has been <unk> .
I 'll bet .
Would it really put you out if they <unk> that on the grill for a minute or two ?
This is <unk> .
It 's good .
Which one is that ?
Raw what ?
Three months .
We learn quickly .
We adapt .
It is our strength ... what we were bred for , to adapt to hostile <unk> .
I don 't think I could ever learn to read that shit .
How long did it take you to learn English ?
Yeah , sure .
I knew that ...
If I may make a <unk> ... We have different weak spots than you do .
Next time , a blow to the <unk> <unk> under the arm , here , will produce the effect I think you were looking for .
In the <unk> , we were <unk> four to a room .
The <unk> process was entirely random .
We did not get to stay with our friends ... or families ... How could a <unk> like you ever pick a roommate like him ?
From quarantine , when my people first arrived here .
He and I were <unk> together .
You know that guy ?
Stay back !
I 'm okay .
Matthew , you don 't have <unk> .
That 's very colorful .
But see -- now I 've got a problem .
I don 't seem to be getting much <unk> from you , Porter .
So I guess we 're gonna have to take this little <unk> down to my office , ya know ?
Your mother <unk> out of season .
Tell me .
Screw me ?
That can 't be right .
Screw you .
I 'll handle it .
But I-- .
Back off , George .
Uh , Matthew ...
Your name wouldn 't happen to be Porter , would it ?
At the end of the bar .
Who said that ?
My partner is dead !
Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a <unk> down in Slagtown , where he 's home and dry , ' cause nobody sees nothing , nobody says nothing ... <unk> to work with me ?
You don 't like me ... you don 't like any of us .
You have nothing but <unk> for us .
And yet you become an <unk> from your club of detectives by making me your partner ... Why 'd I do what ?
Why did you do it ?
We 'd like to ask you about a business <unk> of your , Warren Hubley .
<unk> Kipling ?
No shit ?
Listen , we just need a minute of your time ...
He has not been home since that day .
But she told me where to find him .
Did you talk to him ?
She didn 't know him .
But she said her son might .
<unk> .
What about the other guy ?
A week ago two men came to see her husband .
After they left , he was very frightened .
She identified one of the men from a <unk> I showed her .
It was Hubley .
Did you learn anything ?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband 's death well .
Why the <unk> ? !
Great , fine .
You talk to the wife .
I believe I should interview the widow alone .
So the Slag they 're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery .
I 'd say that " possible " connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible .
Okay , next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night .
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane <unk> are not <unk> to us .
My <unk> 's brother is one .
How the hell do you know that ?
Newcomers working near methane <unk> at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against <unk> .
And still it fits ?
Well ... Yeah , it 's rubber .
It <unk> .
And that fits ?
Get the picture ?
A rubber .
A <unk> .
You know ... <unk> Island <unk> ?
<unk> , human men , put them on their , uh -- <unk> -- to protect against having babies .
You need this for anything ?
What is this ?
Shouldn 't we examine their personal effects ?
Nothing ?
Nothing .
What 's this ?
What 's going on ?
Great .
Well , I 'm sure glad that 's settled , aren 't you ?
Yes ... no , it is not unreasonable .
Although I-- <unk> .
Good .
Well , would you be willing to accept the theory , George , that ... possibly ... by <unk> the evidence from one case we might <unk> some small <unk> of light on the other ?
Does that sound unreasonable to you ?
Well ... yes , quite possibly .
Nothing 's wrong .
I just want to get something straight .
You agree that there 's a good chance these two <unk> are somehow related , right ?
What is wrong ?
Well , there 's a thing about partners , about being somebody 's partner .
You do for each other .
And other people 's rules don 't mean shit .
It 's the rules set up between the two of you , that 's all that counts .
Understand ?
Okay .
Well , my friend and partner was shot last night and I 'm after the <unk> that did it .
As my partner , I 'm asking you to respect me and help me find him .
Yes .
Look , you want to fit in here , right ?
You want to learn how to get along ?
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case .
The Captain <unk> The guys at the mini-mart last night made a <unk> stab at the money in the till -- but I don 't think that 's what they were there for .
I think we got us a couple 'a executions on our hands , George ...
There was no wallet ... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
<unk> .
A real <unk> of the community .
Was Hubley missing anything when they found him ?
Was he ripped off ?
Nice signal , <unk> !
Through the chest .
<unk> both the primary and secondary hearts .
With two <unk> <unk> <unk> in the chest .
His body was discovered three days ago , in an <unk> off of <unk> <unk> , near downtown .
Let 's talk Hubley .
That is exactly so .
It is like your name ... Sykes .
I 'm sure it doesn 't bother you at all that it sounds like " ss 'ai k 'ss " , two words in my language which mean " <unk> " and " <unk> " .
Anyway , what 's it matter to you if we think it 's funny , right ?
<unk> you care ?
<unk> .
You don 't mind if I stick to George , do you ?
My true name is Ss <unk> T <unk> ' .
Man , somebody really hung one on you !
I 've heard some good ones for you guys ... <unk> <unk> , Harley <unk> .
I guess the people at <unk> got a little <unk> after a while , coming up with names for a <unk> of a million of you .
You weren 't at the back of the line , were you , George ?
I am George .
What 's that ?
Look , Jetson .
Get this straight in your head .
We 're not pals , we 're not married , and we ain 't gonna take long <unk> <unk> together ... We 're just partners .
And don 't call me Sergeant .
Call me Sykes ... or Matt if you have to .
Sergeant ...
I 'd like to thank you for what you 're doing .
... and we work my hours .
I 'll do the driving , you do the <unk> .
You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all .
No ... two .
Yeah , the shells are too big for six in an <unk> .
Hell , Matt , you don 't need but one .
Only holds five .
<unk> <unk> Magnum .
You 're talking twice the <unk> energy of .44 Magnum hot <unk> .
What is it ?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find ... Well , this is it .
...
They took the stuff out , all of it -- this afternoon .
Don 't piss him off , <unk> <unk> .
When he gets like this , I can 't control him .
I 've seen this before .
He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy 's spine out and show it to him .
Nothing I could do .
I <unk> go throw up .
Yes it is .
Thirty-five percent pure <unk> gas in there .
I don 't know how these fellas do it .
That where Anderson worked ?
I think you 're gonna find he 's taken the rest of his life off .
Wait .
You know who it looks like ?
Yeah .
Anderson .
Uh ... James Anderson .
He isn 't in today .
He took the afternoon off .
Who else can I ask around here ?
To be honest , it 's hard to say .
I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me .
We think he could 'a been involved , yeah .
You know him ?
You think this is the guy who did it ?
Well , one of the men didn 't like him so much ... Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager .
The men liked him .
I 'm really gonna have to <unk> to fill his shoes .
Sure .
Just a minute .
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing ?
I 'm sorry , Matt .
Nothing here seems to be matching up ... Yeah -- we met him .
Wonderful boy ... close personal friend of George 's here .
<unk> December one .
He and his wife moved first to <unk> , then <unk> , California -- <unk> that is -- settled in L.A. in April .
Field of expertise : <unk> chemical <unk> .
He and his wife have one child , a son .
For you , anything .
Try Joshua Strader , will ya , <unk> ' ?
Here 's Hubley .
<unk> Quarantine on <unk> <unk> , relocated first to <unk> , then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year .
Field of expertise : chemical <unk> .
Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery .
That 's all I know .
You want anything more , you ask somebody else .
Yeah , I heard of it .
Yeah ...
I seen him around .
<unk> <unk> dude named Strader .
Joshua Strader .
<unk> a club on the west side .
<unk> .
One of the two men was Hubley , right ?
What about the other one ?
Did you know him ?
What 's that ?
Ss <unk> <unk> ' .
Jesus , are the questions too tough for you already ?
Let 's try <unk> Is your name Porter ?
Did he find anything ?
<unk> for some foreign <unk> in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day .
What kind of test ?
You mean the <unk> ?
They 're <unk> up now .
You guys finished the <unk> on Strader yet ?
Yeah , I 'll bet .
Oh , here 's an extra <unk> if you need one .
We 're just about to start cutting in .
You 're welcome to stick around if you want .
It 's really <unk> stuff .
That 's the way these people are .
You don 't hit both <unk> you just piss them off .
Lucky nothing .
I had to empty my damn gun into him .
Lucky for you , you got him in both of his ... well , what we <unk> <unk> to as ... hearts .
Yeah .
You took this <unk> out , too , didn 't you ?
Fedorchuk couldn 't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets .
No I.D.
on him and -- well , you know , no fingerprints -- so it could be tough .
Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn 't make a facial match .
Yeah ... he was one <unk> <unk> .
White male , twenty-seven .
Let 's see ... <unk> sheet shows one armed robbery conviction , a couple for sale of a <unk> <unk> .
Oh yeah , and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock .
The human ?
Yeah , right .
Don 't push your luck .
Anyway , according to the sheet , the guy you nailed outside by the <unk> Come on .
You got nothin ' better to do , cushy county job like yours .
You know I 've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning ... Don 't tell me what to think .
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a <unk> ... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer <unk> , and Hubley 's body being found over in the Newcomer community ... Granger and Pitts are already on it .
You ?
<unk> policy .
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle 's death .
You know that .
Leave that for Fedorchuk .
Captain .
I 'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective .
Yeah , Sykes ?
I 'll cover you !
Get outta there ! !
I can 't !
Do you mind !
Get outta there !
I got him .
Don 't get pinned .
Watch the driver .
I 'm going for a better angle on the door .
Yeah , that 's <unk> .
Mine , too .
Of course .
Right in the trunk of the car .
You got your vest ?
Whatever gave you that idea ?
Does that look at all suspicious to you ?
Shit , if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it , we 'd be holding the reception at Buddy 's <unk> .
But you 're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing .
Goddammit , <unk> -- I want to see Kristin get married , okay ?
<unk> Hey , look -- we 've known Kristin since ... since she was <unk> in that <unk> up in Big Bear .
Remember ?
You and <unk> <unk> the wall so hard , me and Carol were picking <unk> out of our hair for a week ... What ?
Put on your <unk> suit and your <unk> tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church .
<unk> .
Me and Carol are going .
How can I go ?
It is .
<unk> their <unk> 's the same .
Uh , seems to be in front and behind .
Talk to me , Hudson .
Can 't lock up ...
<unk> ?
<unk> !
<unk> mission .
There 's some <unk> colonists ' daughters we gotta rescue from <unk> .
Hey , ' Top . '
What 's the <unk> ?
Let 's go ... let 's go .
<unk> through !
<unk> !
No shit ?
I 'm impressed .
Would you , Sir ?
Christ .
I never saw such a <unk> old women .
You want me to fetch your <unk> , Hudson ?
This floor 's freezing .
Say again ?
All after incinerators ?
Uh , ... Apone , I want you to lay down a <unk> fire with the incinerators and fall back by <unk> to the APC , over .
Let 's go .
Pull ' em out .
<unk> only .
I want <unk> <unk> .
Vasquez , take point .
Let 's move .
First squad up , on line .
Hicks , get yours in a <unk> .
Watch the rear .
Ten seconds , people .
Look sharp !
Set down sixty meters this side of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> dust off on my ' clear , ' then stay on station .
Awright !
I want a nice clean <unk> this time .
Okay , let 's do it .
Awright .
<unk> A.
<unk> up .
Let 's move .
Two minutes .
Somebody wake up Hicks .
... that 's better .
<unk> it around a bit .
Well , thanks , I -- You did okay , <unk> .
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of <unk> the size of <unk> .
She 's alive .
They brought her here and you know it .
Ripley ... WE 'RE NOT <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
See you soon .
It 's going to be <unk> .
You better get going .
All right .
Let 's get on it .
What 'll you need ?
I 'm really the only one <unk> to <unk> the ship anyway .
Believe me , I 'd prefer not to .
I may be synthetic but I 'm not stupid .
What ?
I 'll go .
I 'm afraid so .
The crash did too much damage .
The overload is <unk> , at this point .
And it 's too late to shut it down ?
I 'm <unk> total systems failure in a little under four hours .
The <unk> radius will be about thirty <unk> .
About equal to ten <unk> .
How long until it blows ?
That 's it .
See it ?
Emergency <unk> .
Hard to say .
It may have been blind <unk> ... <unk> to the heat of whatever ... but she did choose to <unk> her eggs in the one spot where we couldn 't destroy her without <unk> ourselves .
That 's if she exists , of course .
Could it be intelligent ?
Well , the queen is always physically <unk> then the others .
A termite queen 's <unk> is so <unk> with eggs that it can 't move at all .
It is fed and <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> .
She is the center of their lives , quite literally the mother of their <unk> .
You 're saying one of those things <unk> all the eggs ?
That is the question of the hour .
We could assume a <unk> to certain <unk> forms who have <unk> organization .
An <unk> of termite colony , for example , is <unk> by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs .
But these things come from eggs ... so where are all the eggs coming from .
Yes .
That follows .
Which would mean lots of those <unk> , right ?
One for each person ... over a hundred at least .
Now let me get this straight .
The <unk> <unk> the colonists , carried them over there , cocooned them to be hosts for more of those ...
I 've <unk> a <unk> <unk> responsible for the <unk> .
It seems to be <unk> .
He should wake up soon .
Sorry to disappoint you .
I expected more of you , Ripley .
I thought you would be <unk> than this .
Look , maybe the thing didn 't even exist , right ?
And if I 'd made it a major security situation , the Administration would 've <unk> in .
Then no <unk> rights , nothing .
You sent them out there and you didn 't even warn them , Burke .
Why didn 't you warn them ?
You sent them to that ship .
I just checked the colony log ... <unk> dates <unk> .
<unk> Burke , <unk> <unk>
Now , wait a second -- But they will know about it , Burke .
From me .
Just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and <unk> colonists here -- You 've been doing your <unk> .
Look , they can 't <unk> it if they don 't know about it .
You just try getting a dangerous organism past <unk> quarantine .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Those specimens are worth millions to the <unk> division .
Now , if you 're smart we can both come out of this heroes .
Set up for life .
This operation is under military <unk> and Hicks is next in chain of command .
Right ?
Corporal Hicks ! ?
What rank ?
I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here .
Don 't make me pull rank , Ripley .
You son of a bitch .
Bullshit !
This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with here .
We can 't just <unk> <unk> them -- They can bill me .
I got a tab running .
What 's second ?
Well , I mean ... I know this is an <unk> moment , but let 's not make snap <unk> .
Let 's move cautiously .
First , this physical <unk> had a <unk> dollar <unk> attached to it -- Why not ?
Now hold on a second .
I 'm not <unk> that action .
No good .
How do we know it 'll effect their <unk> ?
I say we take off and <unk> the entire <unk> from <unk> .
It 's the only way to be sure .
She 's right .
That 's not what I mean .
Gorman , if your men have to use their weapons in there , they 'll <unk> the <unk> system .
Yeah ?
Maybe the <unk> like the heat , that 's why they built ...
They 're right under the primary heat <unk> .
<unk> .
One of thirty or so , all over the planet .
They 're completely automated .
We <unk> them , by the way .
That the atmosphere <unk> ?
I suggest you study the <unk> Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .
I hope you 're right .
I really do .
Well , it didn 't <unk> to me .
It 's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board .
You never said anything about an <unk> being here !
Why not ?
That 's the plan .
My word on it .
Burke , just tell me one thing .
That you 're going out there to kill them .
Not study .
Not bring back .
Just burn them out ... clean ... forever .
<unk> ?
Oh , Ripley .
Hi ... No !
The answer is no .
Now please go .
I 'm sorry .
Just go , would you .
Yes , and I 've read it .
You wake up every night , <unk> <unk> , the same nightmare over and over ...
Spare me , Burke .
I 've had my <unk> <unk> this month .
If you go .
It 's a second chance , kiddo .
And it 'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it .
You gotta get back on the horse ...
If I go .
What if I said I could get you <unk> as a flight officer ?
And that the company has agreed to pick up your <unk> ?
It 's all I could get .
Anyway , it keeps my mind off of ... everything .
<unk> off are worse .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , that sort of thing ?
That 's right .
I heard you were working in the cargo <unk> .
Yeah , yeah .
I saw the commercial .
Well , the <unk> <unk> that colony with the Colonial Administration , against <unk> rights .
We 're getting into a lot of <unk> ... ' Building Better <unk> . '
What about you ?
What 's your interest in this ?
I was <unk> , <unk> and <unk> by you guys ... and now you want me to go back out there ?
Forget it .
Hear me out ... No .
There 's no way !
You are a head case .
Have a <unk> .
They had their minds made up before I even went in there .
They think I 'm a head case .
You had them eating out of your hand , kiddo .
Just tell them what happened .
The important thing is to stay cool and <unk> .
I get the picture .
Look , I believe you , but there are going to be some <unk> in there .
You got <unk> , you got <unk> <unk> commission , you got <unk> administration , insurance company guys ... You read my deposition ... it 's complete and <unk> .
<unk> .
Hmmmm .
They still haven 't <unk> that one .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , Little <unk> , Wisconsin .
No children .
Amy .
Amanda <unk> .
<unk> name , I guess .
<unk> : <unk> ... at time of death .
Two years ago .
I 'm sorry .
Is she ... ?
Well , I was going to wait until after the <unk> ... Have they <unk> my daughter yet ?
You 'd <unk> right through the <unk> systems .
It 's blind luck that <unk> team caught you when they ... are you all right ?
<unk> ... oh , Christ ... Shit .
Apone , collect magazines from everybody .
We can 't have any <unk> in there .
We 're talking <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 'S .
<unk> <unk> .
Every adult <unk> had one surgically <unk> .
What 's he <unk> for ?
It 's <unk> .
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony .
Dead on all <unk> .
Still nothing from the colony ?
We 're trained to deal with these kinds of situations .
These Colonial <unk> are some tough <unk> , and they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Nothing they can 't handle ... right , Lieutenant ?
You wouldn 't be going in with the <unk> .
I can guarantee your safety .
Look , we don 't know what 's going on out there .
It may just be a down transmitter .
But if it 's not , I want you there ... as an <unk> .
That 's all .
Forget it .
All right , I guess .
One hell of a <unk> .
Look , Ripley ...
I ... How do you feel ?
They 're but off !
Do something !
I told them to fall back ...
Shut up .
Just shut up !
GET <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
DO IT NOW !
So ?
So ?
So ... then the <unk> <unk> <unk> down .
So .
<unk> inside .
I don 't know .
What is it ?
Gorman !
Give it a rest would you .
Where are your parents ?
You have to try ... Apone ... where are your people ?
Anybody in <unk> ?
One of us ?
The structure seems <unk> .
They have power .
Hold at forty .
Slow circle of the complex .
<unk> ... <unk> .
How may drops is this for you , Lieutenant ?
You tell me .
I only work here .
We 're not making that out too well .
What is it ?
<unk> .
But , it looks like all of them .
Over at the processing station ... sublevel ' C ' under the south tower .
<unk> ?
<unk> !
Stop your <unk> ' and drop your <unk> !
Found ' em .
Okay , stand by in operations .
Let 's go .
Sir , the CPU is on-line .
He 's coming in .
I feel <unk> already .
... We 're coming in .
All right , the area 's <unk> .
Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us .
First team head for operations .
Hudson , see if you can get their CPU on line .
Hicks , meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower ... How do I get out of this <unk> outfit ?
Are there any questions ?
Hudson ?
All we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony and that a <unk> may be involved .
Is this going to be a <unk> fight , Sir , on another <unk> ?
What 's the question ?
Hudson , Sir .
He 's Hicks .
Yes , Hicks ?
Sir ?
At <unk> .
I 'm sorry we didn 't have time to <unk> before we left Gateway but ... <unk> ' A !
Let 's go !
Let 's go !
Six meters .
Five .
What the <unk> -- Well you 're not reading it right !
Let 's get these things lit .
<unk> meters .
Do it !
The corner !
Ready ?
I want you two walking the perimeter .
I know we 're all in <unk> out shape but stay <unk> and alert .
We 've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand .
Maybe we got ' em <unk> .
I don 't fucking believe this .
Do you believe this ?
We got problems .
<unk> .
<unk> .
Then all we need 's a deck of cards .
All right , let 's move like we got a purpose .
Are you finished ?
You okay ?
Well that 's great !
That 's just fucking great , man .
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do , man ?
We 're in some real pretty shit now !
Not that tunnel , the other one !
Let 's get the fuck out of here !
Sure , Hicks .
Save it .
Don 't be long , Ellen .
Ellen .
We ain 't going anywhere .
Hicks , don 't let him leave .
All right !
She 's alive .
I believe it .
But we gotta get moving !
Now !
No !
No !
She 's alive !
We have to -- Stand back .
<unk> .
We didn 't miss anything .
They learned .
They cut the power and avoided the guns .
They must have found another way in , something we missed .
Get back here , both of you .
<unk> back to <unk> .
It 's game time .
Let 's waste him .
No offense .
You know , Burke , I don 't know which species is worse .
You don 't see them screwing each other over for a fucking <unk> .
The only way it would work is if he <unk> certain <unk> on the trip back .
Then he could <unk> the bodies and make up any story he liked .
Wait a minute .
We 'd know about it .
Yeah .
I 've noticed .
Look , you started this .
Now show me everything .
I can handle myself .
Well , that 's the <unk> <unk> ... you probably don 't want to mess with that .
What 's this ?
If it comes to that , I 'll do us both .
Let 's see that it doesn 't Here , I 'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine .
Hicks , I 'm not going to wind up like those others .
You 'll take care of it won 't you , it if comes to that ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
They 'll get us .
But they don 't know that .
They 're probably looking for other ways to get in .
That 'll take them awhile .
Newt time then can walk right up and knock .
Can 't tell .
Lots .
<unk> gun 's down to twenty .
Ten .
It 's out .
Now many ?
On my way .
They 're in the approach corridor .
That 's right .
So we put up <unk> <unk> at these <unk> ... ... and seal these ducts here and here .
Then they can only come at us from these two <unk> and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units , here .
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex .
All right .
There 's a fire door at this end .
The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door .
About seventeen days .
How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ?
Poor bastard .
<unk> surgically before embryo <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , John L. Died during procedure .
They killed him getting it off .
No .
No !
It ain 't you .
They 're inside .
Inside the perimeter .
They 're in here .
You 're just reading me .
It 's inside the complex .
Hudson , give us a break .
Oh , man .
And I was gettin ' short , too !
Four more weeks and out .
Now I 'm gonna buy it on this fuckin ' rock .
It ain 't half fair , man !
Maybe you haven 't been keeping up on <unk> events , but we just got out asses kicked , pal !
Yeah , bullshit .
Watch us .
Look , man , let 's just bug out and call it even , okay ?
All right , we can 't blow the fuck out of them ... why not roll some <unk> of <unk> down there .
<unk> gas the whole <unk> ?
<unk> .
Anywhere .
Fuck you .
Somebody said alien ... she thought they said illegal alien and signed up .
No .
Have you ?
Hey , Vasquez ... you ever been mistaken for a man ?
It 's <unk> ' right .
Look !
Can 't be .
That 's inside the room !
Nine meters .
Eight .
They 're right on us .
Vasquez , how you doing ?
<unk> meters .
Man , this is a big fucking signal .
Ten meters .
I don 't know , an acid hole in a duct .
Something under the <unk> , not on the plans .
I don 't know !
Fifteen meters .
Seal the door .
<unk> twenty meters .
Just get back here !
This signal 's weird ... must be some interference or something .
There 's movement all over the place ... What do you mean , they cut the power ?
How could they cut the power , man ?
They 're animals .
They cut the power .
Oh , right !
Right !
With those things running around .
No way .
Well then somebody 's just going to have to go out there .
Take a <unk> <unk> and go out there and plug in <unk> .
What about the colony transmitter ?
That up-link tower down at the other end .
Why can 't we use that ?
Think of what ?
We 're fucked .
I don 't care how !
Think of a way .
Think of something .
How ?
The transmitter was on the APC .
It 's <unk> .
We need the other <unk> .
The on one the <unk> .
We have to bring it down on remote , somehow .
Uh , what 's next ?
Thanks .
Yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here .
This service tunnel is how they 're moving back and forth .
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training .
Man , we 're not going to make it seventeen hours !
Those things are going to come in here , just like they did before , man ... they 're going to come in here and get us , man , long before ... Oh , God .
Jesus .
This ain 't happening .
You can 't help them .
Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others .
Hey ... hey !
Look , <unk> and <unk> aren 't dead , man .
Looks like it <unk> him .
The embryo , the second form , hosts in the victim 's body for several hours .
<unk> .
Then it ... ... then it ... <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> -- Sounds like you , Hicks .
Tell him , as far as I 'm concerned , he finds something it 's his .
So what do I tell this guy ?
Christ .
Some <unk> in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a <unk> reference in the middle of nowhere , we look .
They don 't say why , and I don 't ask .
I don 't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer 's always ' don 't ask . '
There 's a guy on the <unk> , mom-and-pop survey team .
<unk> he 's <unk> on something and wants to know if his claim will be <unk> .
Yeah .
What ?
You remember you sent some <unk> out to that <unk> , out past the <unk> <unk> , a couple days ago ?
No ..
I 've slept enough .
Bad dreams again ?
Do you want something to help you sleep ?
Just a couple of days .
Do you feel up to a visitor ?
How long have I been on Gateway station ?
Just terrible ?
That 's better than yesterday at least .
Terrible .
And how are we today ?
Yes , honey .
I think we both can .
Can we dream ?
That 's right .
Are we going to sleep now ?
Right here , baby .
Right here .
Mommy ... Mommy ?
Newt , I want you to hang on , now .
Hang on tight .
I knew you 'd come .
Newt , wait !
This way .
Come on , we 're almost there !
Sure .
Go left .
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here ?
Come on .
Crawl faster .
Look !
Burke !
Open the door !
I know , honey .
Me too .
Mommy ... I mean , Ripley ... I 'm scared .
Sssh .
Don 't move .
We 're in trouble .
<unk> ... ?
Where are ... ?
Newt .
Newt , wake up .
I 'll be right in the other room , Newt .
And look ... I can see you on that camera right up there .
Don 't go !
Please .
You mean dead .
Gone .
Where is she ?
Yes .
A little girl .
Did you ever have a baby ?
No , it 's different , honey .
Isn 't that how babies come ?
I mean people babies ... they grow inside you ?
I don 't know , Newt .
That 's the truth .
Did one of those things grow inside her ?
Well , some kids can 't handle it like you can .
Why do they tell little kids that ?
Yes , there are , aren 't there .
My mommy always said there were no monsters .
No real ones .
But there are .
Oh .
Sorry , Newt .
Ripley ... she doesn 't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic .
I don 't want to ... I have scary dreams .
Now you just lie here and have a <unk> .
You 're exhausted .
You don 't have to be sorry .
It wasn 't your fault .
I 'm sorry , Newt .
I guess we 're not leaving , right ?
You 're really something , ace .
Yeah , you know .
In the <unk> , under the floor .
I was the ace .
I could hide better than anybody .
The ' maze ' ?
You mean the air ducts ?
I was the best at the game .
I knew the whole maze .
And hope to die ?
<unk> my heart .
You promise ?
Newt .
Look at me ... Newt .
I won 't leave you .
I promise .
They 're dead .
They 'd be here if they could , honey .
I know they would .
Because you 'll be gone soon , like the others .
Like everybody .
You 'll be dead and you 'll leave me alone .
Why not ?
I don 't want you for a friend .
What about me ?
<unk> .
She 's my only friend .
Newt .
My <unk> 's Newt .
Nobody calls me <unk> except my dork brother .
What did you say ?
Sweet Jesus .
<unk> , maybe seventy families .
How many colonists ?
What are you talking about .
What people ?
Because I don 't have to .
The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and ' hostile organism ' or alien ship .
And by the way , they call it <unk> now .
Why won 't you check out <unk> ?
... because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew , within twelve hours of <unk> ...
Thank you , Officer Ripley .
That will be ... Look , I can see where this is going .
But I 'm telling you those things exist .
Back on that <unk> is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs .
Thousands .
Do you understand ?
I suggest you find it , using the flight <unk> 's data .
Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey <unk> comes back with a little surprise ... That 's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock !
Like I said .
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you <unk> ...
It did not , however , contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you <unk> picked up .
Look , I told you ... At present the girls only peck me .
Their <unk> surely will <unk> me .
But one little beak in my own , And I 'll up to heaven be flown !
At present the girls only peck me .
But one little beak in my own , And I 'll up to heaven be flown .
Up to heaven be flown !
Up to heaven be flown !
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish .
A willing , billing , lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish .
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely .
But if she won 't fly to my aid , Then into a ghost I must fade .
I need to net one birdie only But if she won 't fly to my aid , Then into a ghost I must fade .
To a ghost I must fade !
To a ghost I must fade !
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish .
A willing , billing , lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish .
Then that would be eating and drinking I 'd live like a Prince without thinking .
The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman 's much better than wine !
Then that would be eating and drinking !

A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish .
A willing , billing , lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish .
Be my most tasty little dish !
Be my most tasty little dish !
What do you mean ?
His Grace is very angry with you .
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it .
Indeed .
Well , I think that went off remarkably well , don 't you ?
Certainly !
Follow me , please .
The Archbishop would like a word .
Meaning you didn 't like it .
Extremely clever .
What did you think of the music ?
You were sublime .
How was I ?
Tell me honestly .
Nothing !
He can marry who he <unk> .
I don 't give a damn .
Well , what does it matter to you ?
The marriage !
What ?
Did you know ?
Had you heard ?
Looks don 't concern me , Maestro .
Only talent interests a woman of taste .
Looks and talent don 't always go together , Katherina .
Why ?
You might be disappointed .
What does he look like ?
Perhaps .
Oh .
Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway .
My dear , it will hardly <unk> your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a <unk> prostitute for a <unk> .
Turkish ?
Oh , if it 's Turkish , that 's different .
I want to be in it .
A Turkish brothel .
Oh !
A brothel .
What 's that ?
In a <unk> .
Where ?
Well , do you know where it 's set , my dear ?
Why not ?
Well even if there is , I don 't think you want to get involved with this one .
How do you know ?
No .
Is there a part for me ?
Yes .
And he 's been commissioned to write an opera .
Is it true ?
Oh ?
News <unk> fast in Vienna .
Well , I heard you met Herr Mozart .
Really ?
What else did he tell you today ?
Give me some gossip .
Well ?
How do you like it ?
It 's Turkish .
My hairdresser tells me everything 's going to be Turkish this year !
Good morning .
Maestro .
Excuse us , Fraulein .
Good night , Signore .
No , no , no , no .
You can 't take him away now .
This is his night .
<unk> 't you introduce us , Wolfgang ?
I assume she 's the <unk> in that department .
There can 't be any other reason you 'd marry someone like that .
What ? ?
Is she a good fuck ?
I 'm so <unk> .
No , she 's fine .
Is her mother still lying on the floor ?
Oh - excuse me !
I 'll be right back .
Don 't bother .
What ?
Don 't bother !
Katherina !
I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do .
I 'm going to write another <unk> for you .
Something even more amazing for the second act .
I have to get some water .
Her mother is lying on the stage .
Oh , Your Grace - I thank Your Grace !
I thank you !
You have leave to try .
Oh , sir , he 's never <unk> me in anything .
Please , Your Grace , give him one more chance .
And how will you make him keep it ?
Yes , sir , that 's the truth .
But don 't blame him .
The fault is mine .
I was too <unk> with him .
But not again .
Never again , I promise !
I <unk> you - let me bring him back here .
I 'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
Your son is an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Sir - I 'm not surprised .
Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or <unk> .
He has sold himself to Vienna .
Let Vienna look out for him .
Oh sir , yes !
He 's about to make the worst mistake of his life .
Some little Viennese <unk> is trying to trick him into marriage .
I know my son .
He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him .
Hardly .
But he needs to be here in Salzburg , Your Grace .
He needs me and he needs you .
Your <unk> , your understanding .
No !
I won 't have him back .
Then try harder , Mozart .
I have no intention of <unk> you .
You will remain in my service and learn your place .
Go now .
No , Your Grace !
I mean with all humility , no .
I would rather you <unk> me .
It 's obvious I don 't <unk> .
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg .
Your father is waiting for you there <unk> .
I will speak to you further when I come .
If His Grace is not satisfied with me , he can <unk> me .
How much <unk> am I to <unk> from you ?
The more license I allow you , the more you take .
<unk> ?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants ?
Why what , sir ?
Oh shut up .
I 'm sick to death of that tune .
In the <unk> , I have got a good dinner .
Not a sausage or stew , but a singer .
Not a sausage or stew but a singer .
Is the treat that I 'll eat for my meat !
Are you drunk ?
You invited me .
And my horse .
Here he is .
<unk> !
Dinner ?
How dare you ?
I am a <unk> .
I only dine with people of my own height .
I 've come to <unk> !
Who the devil are you ?
What do you want ?
Don <unk> !
What are you talking about ?
I feel wrong .
I feel wrong being here .
Why ?
Yes !
Now ?
I want to go back to Vienna .
Where ?
I want to go !
What is it ?
Please !
Let me sit here .
Let me stay here with you .
I promise I won 't say all word .
I 'll just be here , so you know no one 's going to hurt you .
Please , please !
Go back to bed .
It 's killing me .
Why not ?
I can 't write it !
Give me one reason I can understand .
Give me two more weeks .
Please .
Oh yes , sir .
He 's all right .
And he 's working on it very hard .
This is my wife , Stanzi .
I 've been sick , but I 'm all right now .
Aren 't I ?
Why ?
No .
Don 't answer it !
You 'd think I was mad .
Why not ?
I 'm not telling you .
What 's that ?
Oh !
Who gave you this ?
How much is it ?
Wolfi , who gave you this ?
I heard voices .
No one .
Who was that ?
Shut up !
I 'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money .
<unk> , I 'll put it in your hand !
Half the house !
You 'll never see a penny .
I want it here , in my hand .
Well , you liked it , didn 't you ?
<unk> .
I don 't trust this man .
And I didn 't like what he did with your opera .
It was common .
Oh , Stanzi .
When ?
We need money now .
Either he pays now , or you don 't do it .
Why not ?
Half the house !
You 're not going to do this ?
I 'm talking about now .
How much will you give him now ?
Down payment ?
Half the receipts !
Stanzi !
Your father is dead .
What ?
Wolfi !
Your father is dead .
Salzburg .
We were just talking about Salzburg .
If you 've come from my friend the Fartsbishop , you 've arrived at just the right moment .
Because I 've got good news for him .
I 'm done with Vienna .
It 's over , finished , done with !
Done with !
Done with !
These gentlemen are from Salzburg .
Yes , my love ?
Wolfi .
We 'll have a little party .
Come in .
Come in .
You know Herr <unk> ?
This is !
a very nice girl .
No , it 's right he should hear .
I 'm sick to death of it .
We can 't do anything right for you , can we ?
Stanzi !
Look , old man , you stay out of this .
We spend a fortune on you , more than we can possibly afford , and all you do is <unk> , morning to night .
And then you think you can - Oh , damn !
She won 't talk to me .
She says she has to speak to you .
Well , ask her !
I don 't know .
What does she want ?
There 's a young girl to see you .
Wolfi , I think your father 's tired .
I 'll cook us something here .
What ?
How can you be so boring ?
Tea !
Wolfi !
Tea ?
Who wants tea ?
Let 's go out !
This calls for a <unk> .
You don 't want tea , Papa .
Let 's go dancing .
Papa loves parties , don 't you ?
May I offer you some tea , Herr Mozart ?
He 's not Herr Mozart .
Call him Papa .
Stop it , Wolfi .
I look dreadful .
Welcome to our house , Herr Mozart .
My Stanzi - look at her !
Isn 't she beautiful ?
Come on now , <unk> , Papa .
Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter ?
I love you !
I love you !
Yes !
No !
Sssh .
What is it ?
Tell me .
Tell them to go !
What 's the matter with you ?
Tell them to go away .
I don 't want to see anybody .
Stop it now .
Stop it .
I 've brought some friends to meet you .
They 're next door waiting .
Do we have anything to eat ?
They 're all starving .
This isn 't <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> !
Shut up !
Just shut up !
I don 't need them .
All they want to see is your work .
What 's wrong with that ?
Don 't be stupid .
How are we going to live , Wolfi ?
Do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
Well , don 't do that again !
Yes !
You <unk> money from your mother ?
Well , I 'm not <unk> any more money from my mother , and that 's that !
Oh yes ?
You always know everything .
No , they will not .
I know how things work in this city .
They 'll come anyway .
They love me here .
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come <unk> .
We 'd be set up for life !
Oh , leave me alone .
I think you 're mad !
You 're really mad !
Of course .
Excuse me , Wolfi .
Mama is not feeling very well .
Can we leave now ?
Eat my - ah !
Yes .
Eat Tish-I <unk> .
What ?
Tish-I 'm <unk> .
What 's that ?
<unk> - but <unk> - but I <unk> - love but I love <unk> - You .
I love you !
<unk> !
<unk> - marry Em - marry me !
No , no !
You 're a fiend .
I 'm not going to marry a fiend .
A dirty fiend at that .
Just say it - you 'll see .
It 's very serious .
Em iram !
Em iram !
No !
No , this is serious .
Say it backwards .
No , I 'm not playing this game .
Em iram !
Em iram !
Sra-I 'm-sick .
Sick - kiss I 'm - my Kiss my !
Sra-I 'm-sick - Kiss my <unk> !
No , no .
Say it backwards , <unk> .
Sra-I 'm-sick Say it backwards !
Yes , you are .
You 're very sick .
Sra-I 'm-sick !
Sra-I 'm sick !
Oh , ha , ha , ha .
Yes , I think it 's brilliant .
You 've been doing it for years .
Do you think that 's funny ?
Why ?
People <unk> backwards .
That 's stupid .
Because here everything goes backwards .
People walk backwards , dance backwards , sing backwards , and talk backwards .
Why not ?
Go ahead , tell him .
Tell them all .
They won 't understand you anyway .
Your Grace , I 've got something to tell you .
I want to complain about this man .
Fartsbishop !
We are in the <unk> of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg .
Where ?
Yes !
Back !
Back !
Listen - don 't you know where you are ?
No !
No !
No !
I am !
I am !
I 'm stopping it - slowly .
You see !
Look , I 've stopped .
Now we are going back .
Stop it !
Madame , I will respect his .
He asked me to stay here .
I regret we have no servants to show you out , Herr Salieri .
<unk> my wish and go .
He 's not going to work on this anymore .
It is making him ill .
Please .
No .
I was <unk> him .
He asked me .
This is not his handwriting .
And I 'm asking you - He asked me to stay .
No , he doesn 't .
And I don 't want you here .
Just go , please .
He needs me , ma 'am .
Well , thank you very much .
You can go now .
I was at hand .
Why you ?
Your husband is ill , ma 'am .
He took sick .
I brought him home .
What are you doing here ?
Should we stay here ?
It 's a charming room .
I love these <unk> .
Were they here earlier ?
I didn 't notice them I suppose I was too nervous .
What ?
I do apologize for this afternoon .
I <unk> like a silly girl .
Where shall we go ?
Then don 't .
It 's up to you .
Not to be vague , that is the price .
But !
I 'm a married woman !
It 's a post all Vienna <unk> .
If you want it for your husband , come tonight .
Isn 't it obvious ?
What do you mean ?
Some service deserves service in return .
No ?
What for ?
<unk> .
Tonight ?
Come back tonight .
Oh , thank you , sir !
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor .
One word from me and the post is his .
Oh yes .
He 's really proud of his work .
It is <unk> .
Yes , sir .
He doesn 't make copies .
These are originals ?
Yes .
<unk> ?
That 's very tempting , but it 's impossible , I 'm afraid .
Wolfi would be <unk> if he found those were missing .
You see , they 're all originals .
Are you sure you can 't leave that music , and come back again ?
I have other things you might like .
Don 't keep calling me that .
It puts me at such a distance .
I was not born a Court Composer , you know .
I 'm from a small town , just like your husband .
Thank you very much , Your Excellency .
Sir , we really need this job .
We 're desperate .
My husband <unk> far more than he can ever earn .
I don 't mean he 's <unk> - he 's not at all - he works all day long .
It 's just !
he 's not practical .
Money simply slips through his <unk> , it 's really ridiculous , Your Excellency .
I know you help <unk> .
You 're famous for it .
Give him just this one post .
We 'd be forever <unk> !
I see .
No , sir .
This is my own idea .
Then he didn 't send you ?
My husband is a proud man , sir .
He would be <unk> if he knew I 'd come .
Really ?
I - I really cannot do that , Your Excellency .
You see , he doesn 't know I 'm here .
I 'm afraid I 'm not at <unk> this very moment .
Just leave them with me .
I assure you they will be quite safe .
Would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ?
While I wait .
I will look at them , of course , the moment I can .
It will be an honour .
Please give him my warmest .
I understand .
He 's terribly busy , sir .
How charming .
But why did he not come himself ?
That 's right , Your Excellency .
I 've come on <unk> of my <unk> band .
I 'm - I 'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment .
Frau Mozart ?
Madame .
How can I help you ?
Excellency !
Oh yes , and who are you ?
He 's worked for <unk> .
For the Emperor .
Who are you ?
You 're mad !
She 's mad , Wolfi .
Money !
Money !
Oh yes ?
And what 's so intelligent about writing a Requiem ?
You know what 's ridiculous ?
Your libretto , that 's what 's ridiculous .
Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff !
I 'm paying people just to wait for you .
It 's ridiculous !
He 's doing his best .
I 'm paying these people .
Do you realize that ?
Leave him alone !
Look , you little <unk> , do you know how many people I 've hired for you ?
Do you know how many people are waiting ?
I hope so .
I need it immediately .
He 's not in .
But he 's working on it .
He said to tell you .
Where 's our friend ?
Not at all .
Am I <unk> something ?
Ah .
Well .
Ah , I see you 've got your manager with you .
Well , Madame , how about half the receipts ?
How much will you pay him ?
Do you hear him ?
Do you ?
So you are !
The place is a <unk> all the time .
Oh , now I 'm a bad <unk> !
And what do you expect ?
Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
And so you do !
The only time you come out is to eat .
Well , this is none of your business .
Whoever sent you is going to pay , no ?
But you can 't take her without reference .
It 's <unk> of !
What is ridiculous ?
Wolfi has many <unk> in Vienna .
They love him here .
People send us <unk> all the time .
In three months !
Papa .
When , may I ask ?
Oh , yes .
I see that you 're expecting .
Behold !
Behold !
Hey !
Hey !
Behold !
Behold !
<unk> !
He 's adorable !
Be careful !
Be careful !
Young man , I am no stranger to <unk> .
I 'm no stranger to <unk> !
I am sorry , Madame , but no !
I cannot let anyone pass .
Call Herr Mozart !
You call Herr Mozart immediately !
This is <unk> !
I am sorry , Madame , but I have my orders .
Do you know who I am ?
This is my daughter .
I am Frau Weber .
We are <unk> guests !
I am sorry , Madame .
It is not permitted .
Let us pass , please !
Let us pass at once !
We 're with the Emperor .
Yes .
He is a little strange .
What a strange young man .
Michael !
I said play !
Michael , please !
I 'm sure you will find her most willing , Herr Mozart .
She 's really very excited .
She 's been preparing all morning .
People who know say the girl 's got talent .
You must judge for yourself .
If you think she <unk> , say so .
It 's such an honour for us to have you here , Herr Mozart .
And for Gertrude .
Gertrude !
I 've heard about you for <unk> !
I thought you must be an old man .
You can 't be Herr Mozart !
Gertrude !
<unk> .
Thank you , Madame .
Come on now - courage .
<unk> me something you know .
I was .
But she quite <unk> the little I could show her .
Who was your teacher ?
Just one year .
<unk> ?
I 'd like a little wine , if you have it .
Perhaps a little <unk> first ?
A little coffee , or a little chocolate ?
Ah , now !
Here she comes .
Really ?
Well , look at them .
It is not a question of <unk> , Your Majesty .
Your own law <unk> it , I 'm afraid .
Do you like this , Salieri ?
<unk> , Majesty .
<unk> , in the course of the same lesson .
Yes ?
As a matter of fact , one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well !
Really ?
I have to tell you , Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
Of course not .
Majesty , I don 't like to talk against a fellow <unk> .
Oh ?
Well , Sire , I made some <unk> in a routine way .
I was curious to know why he had so few pupils .
It is rather <unk> .
Why not ?
Majesty , I did .
Believe me , it was a most <unk> .
decision .
But finally , I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart .
I don 't think you understand me , Court Composer .
Well .
There it is .
Sire .
You please me , Court Composer .
A very clever idea .
I 'm sure there is a way , Majesty .
Some kind of a little contest .
I could perhaps put together a small <unk> , and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty 's wishes .
Ah-ha .
<unk> .
But I so want Mozart .
Yes , of course .
My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> .
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart .
Yes ?
An interesting idea , Majesty .
But - I 'm thinking about Herr Mozart .
What is your view ?
Oh , Your Majesty , it would be such a tremendous honour !
Your <unk> .
Good morning , Court Composer .
This is my <unk> , the Princess Elizabeth .
<unk> again , Court Composer .
Well , tell him , Mozart .
Name us a German virtue .
Excuse me , Sire , but what do you think these could be ?
Being a <unk> , I would love to learn .
Well , I 'm glad to hear that .
Well , there it is .
Now to business .
Young man , we are going to commission an opera from you .
What do you say ?
My pleasure .
Finally !
Such an <unk> joy .
<unk> <unk> !
And here is our <unk> Court Composer , Herr Salieri .
Ah-ha !
<unk> , Majesty .
Let 's have some fun .
Bring in Herr Mozart , please .
But slowly , slowly .
I need a minute to practice .
You do me too much honour , Sire .
<unk> , Court Composer .
Would you <unk> me to play it as he comes in ?
Majesty .
May I try it ?
It 's just a <unk> , of course .
What a charming idea .
May I see ?
You are <unk> , Court Composer .
I want to meet this young man .
Chamberlain , arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
I think it is an interesting <unk> to keep Mozart in Vienna , Majesty .
It should really <unk> the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty 's intention .
Sire , the whole opera is finished .
Do you know how much work went into it ?
You are <unk> , Mozart !
But you do not <unk> .
Forgive me , Majesty .
I 'm a vulgar man .
But I assure you , my music is not .
Twenty , <unk> !
How about twenty ?
Twenty minutes of <unk> music .
No <unk> .
Well , six or seven minutes !
maybe eight !
Guess !
Guess , Majesty .
Imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
I have no idea .
But it 's new , it 's entirely new .
It 's so new , people will go mad for it .
For example , I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a <unk> , just a man and wife <unk> .
Suddenly the wife 's <unk> little maid comes in <unk> - a very funny situation .
<unk> turns into <unk> .
Then the husband 's <unk> screaming valet comes in .
<unk> turns into quartet .
Then a stupid old <unk> - quartet becomes <unk> , and so on .
On and on , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
How long do you think I can <unk> that ?
Ah , love again .
But , Majesty , this is just a <unk> .
It 's a piece about love .
I think you are rather innocent , my friend .
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to <unk> our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece .
Sire , I swear to Your Majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story .
I have taken out everything that could give offense .
I hate politics .
Mozart , I am a tolerant man .
I do not <unk> things <unk> .
When I do , I have good reason .
Figaro is a bad play .
It <unk> up hatred between the <unk> .
In France it has <unk> nothing but <unk> .
My own dear sister Antoinette <unk> me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people .
I do not wish to see the same <unk> starting here .
Well , Majesty , it is only a <unk> .
Would you tell me why ?
Well , yes , I admit it is .
It is not your place to ask questions .
Is it true ?
Who told you this , Majesty ?
<unk> we hear you are making an opera from it .
Is this true ?
Yes , Sire .
Mozart , are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro <unk> for our theatre ?
Ah !
By all means .
May I introduce my father ?
He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg .
He would so much like to kiss your hand .
It would make his whole stay so <unk> for him .
What is it ?
Majesty , may I ask you to do me the greatest favour ?
Thank you , Sire !
Bravo , Mozart .
Most charming .
Yes , indeed .
Clever man .
Well , my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna .
Twenty-six .
Excuse me , but how old are you ?
Well - Well we haven 't quite received my father 's <unk> , Your Majesty .
Not entirely .
Not <unk> .
Really ?
How delightful .
May I ask when you marry ?
<unk> , Madame .
Majesty , this is Madame Weber .
She is my landlady .
Which few did you have in mind , Majesty ?
My dear , young man , don 't take it too hard .
Your work is <unk> .
It 's <unk> work .
And there are simply too many notes , that 's all .
Cut a few and it will be perfect .
My dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening .
I think I 'm right in saying that , aren 't I , Court Composer ?
I don 't understand .
There are just as many notes , Majesty , as are required .
Neither more nor less .
Well , I mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ?
How shall one say , Director ?
What do you mean , Sire ?
Of course I do .
It 's very good .
Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch <unk> .
So then you like it ?
You really like it , Your Majesty ?
Oh , yes .
Absolutely .
German .
<unk> !
And German ?
Yes , indeed .
It is new , it is , isn 't it , Sire ?
I think so , Sire , yes .
What ?
On one hearing only ?
Keep it , Sire , if you want to .
It is already here in my head .
Ah-ha .
In a <unk> 's <unk> , Majesty .
A Seraglio .
Yes , where ?
It 's actually quite amusing , Majesty .
It 's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a - Well , what is it about ?
Tell us the story .
Because I 've already found the most wonderful libretto !
Why so ?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian ?
Majesty !
Really ?
Oh , <unk> , Signore !
<unk> <unk> !
E <unk> <unk> per <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
And now he has returned the compliment .
Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you .
Oh sir , yes !
The honour is mine .
Absolutely .
The Director of our Opera .
Count Orsini-Rosenberg .
Oh , thank you .
No , no , please !
It is not a holy <unk> .
You know we have met already ?
In this very room .
Perhaps you won 't remember it , you were only six years old .
He was giving the most brilliant little concert here .
As he got off the <unk> , he slipped and fell .
My sister Antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ?
<unk> straight into her arms and said , Will you marry me , yes or no ?
Your Majesty !
Ah-ha .
Well .
There it is .
Good .
He 's here .
Yes , what about him ?
Your Majesty , Herr Mozart - Well , what do you have for me today ?
Well .
There it is .
Yes , sir .
In my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir .
<unk> German .
For plain people .
Ah-ha .
What do you say , Chamberlain ?
Very small pay , I imagine .
I 'm sure he could be <unk> with the right offer .
Say , an opera in German for our <unk> <unk> .
I agree , Majesty , but I 'm afraid it 's not possible .
The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop .
Ah-ha .
Well then , we should make some <unk> to <unk> him .
We could use a good German composer in Vienna , surely ?
Hush !
I 'm talking to His Majesty .
Your Majesty , I wish to <unk> only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all , could teach our children the <unk> they owe to fathers .
It is not for nothing that the Fifth <unk> tells us : ' <unk> your Father and Mother , that your days may be long upon the earth . '
Father - She does .
She says I sleep all day .
No one calls you that .
Don 't worry , I 'm not staying here to be a <unk> .
Papa !
Never mind .
You won 't have to do anything for me ever again .
I 'm leaving !
I never saw this girl in my life .
Is this a kind of joke ?
Are you playing a trick on me ?
Mine ?
Papa , is this your idea ?
But my penalty .
I 've got to have a penalty .
I 'm tired of this game .
Please play without me .
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg , my son .
Yes , Papa , name it .
Name it .
I 'll do anything you say !
This is just a game , Papa .
No , really !
Why not ?
Oh , come , Papa !
What better way could I spend it than on you ?
My <unk> , <unk> , suddenly <unk> Papa !
Thank you .
That 'll be fine .
Don 't spend any money on me .
Didn 't I ?
I thought I did .
I 'm sure I did .
Why didn 't you mention it in your letters ?
Isn 't that marvelous ?
We 're delighted .
It 's too dangerous , Papa .
But they 're going to love it .
Ah , there she is !
You don 't have secrets from me .
It 's a secret .
Why not ?
Oh , let 's not talk about it .
What 's that ?
This one will .
<unk> doesn 't pay .
You know that .
I don 't know .
It 's not important .
I mean , I don 't want pupils .
They get in the way .
I 've got to have time for <unk> .
How many ?
Yes .
Yes .
<unk> ?
How many pupils do you have ?
Who ?
Who says that ?
Now that 's a <unk> lie !
They say you 're in <unk> .
What do you mean ?
It 's wonderful .
Really , it 's - it 's marvelous !
People love me here .
That 's not what I hear .
It couldn 't be better .
How is your financial situation ?
Oh we could , if we wanted to , but Stanzi won 't hear of it .
She wants to do everything herself .
Don 't you have a maid ?
She 's very tired , poor creature .
You know me : I 'm a real pig .
It 's not so easy cleaning up after me .
Oh , yes .
Oh , I mean no - not exactly like this .
I mean today - just today , Stanzi - I remember now .
She had to go - yes !
She had to help her mother .
Yes , she 's like that .
Her mother 's a very sweet woman , you 'll see .
Do you always live like this ?
I don 't know .
Stanzi ?
Stanzi !
Is she not here ?
<unk> ?
Well , of course she <unk> me .
She <unk> me like a <unk> all day long .
She 's the best cook in the world .
I mean , since Mama .
Just wait , you 'll see .
Of course , welcome !
Welcome ten thousand times .
Papa !
my Papa !
Am I not welcome ?
Why are you here ?
I will .
I write to you with urgent news .
I am coming to Vienna .
Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet .
You are too <unk> to see your own danger .
As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours , do as I <unk> , and <unk> my coming .
Are you sure it 's an opera ?
Please don 't ask me to go back again .
I 'm frightened !
I 'm very , very frightened .
Opera ?
Opera !
I suppose so .
He sits there all he time , doing some silly opera .
Is he working ?
I 'm frightened , sir .
Really !
When he speaks , he doesn 't make any sense .
You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father .
And his father 's dead .
Is he working ?
Here , in his stomach .
They bend him right over .
Where ?
I don 't know .
He has <unk> .
What medicine ?
You don 't know what it 's like .
Herr Mozart <unk> me .
He drinks all day , then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
Why ?
What has happened ?
I 'm leaving .
I 'm not working there anymore .
I 'm scared !
Now calm yourself .
Calm .
What 's the matter with you ?
In there , sir .
Where does he work ?
Yes what ?
I think I 've found out about the money , sir .
Of course not .
You 're a good girl .
You 're very kind to do this .
Next time you 're sure they 'll be out of the house , let me know , will you ?
Oh , I wouldn 't know that , sir .
Really ?
What is it he 's writing ?
Oh , yes , sir , all day long .
He never leaves the house until evening .
He just sits there , writing and writing .
He doesn 't even eat .
Then how does he pay for all this ?
Does he work at all ?
Not that I 've seen .
Do any pupils come to the house ?
Oh , thank you , sir .
Bene .
Madame <unk> is here for her lesson , sir .
Bene !
Bene !
Yes , thank you , sir .
Thank you .
Are you well today , Fraulein Lorl ?
I will , sir .
Ah-ha !
<unk> <unk> - my <unk> .
Give my best thanks to the <unk> .
What have you got for me today ?
Let me see .
Good morning , sir .
Ah !
Here she comes .
Fraulein Lorl , good morning .
Yes .
I can live in or out just as you wish .
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn 't want us to know who he is ?
They 'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain <unk> - <unk> .
What ?
My name is Lorl , sir .
I 'm a <unk> .
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
That 's right .
Are you Herr Mozart ?
Yes ?
So let me see it .
Where is it ?
Well , we can .
Look , I asked you if we could start <unk> next week and you said yes .
Because there 's nothing to see .
Why not ?
No .
Can I see it ?
Yes .
What ?
The vaudeville , what 'd you think ?
What ?
Oh !
I 'm sorry !
I 'm sorry !
What have you got for me ?
Is it finished ?
Put it down , I said !
It 's nothing for you .
What is this ?
Put it down !
Wolfi !
Leave that alone !
So there you are .
What do you say ?
No , no , I love that .
I 'd want it to be in German .
I haven 't done anything in German since Seraglio .
Of course !
What else do you think they speak here ?
German !
I 'm serious .
You write a proper part for me with a couple of <unk> songs , I 'll guarantee you 'll have a <unk> <unk> .
Mind you , it 'll have to be in German .
I tell you I picked up a <unk> in <unk> last week - twelve foot long - <unk> up to six <unk> , just like a paper fan .
It 's a miracle .
<unk> ?
<unk> you would .
You belong here , my boy , not the <unk> Court .
You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better !
That 's what people want , you know : fantasy .
You do a big <unk> , fill it with beautiful <unk> tricks and you 'll be absolutely free to do anything you want .
Of course , you 'd have to put a fire in it , because I 've got the best fire machine in the city and a big <unk> - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life .
Oh , and a few trick animals .
You 'd have to use those .
I 'd like to try them <unk> .
I 'm not sure I 'd be much good at it .
Isn 't he marvelous ?
He cost me a <unk> , that horse , but he 's worth it .
I tell you , if you 'd played Don <unk> here it would have been a great success .
I 'm not joking .
These people aren 't fools .
You could do something marvelous for them .
I liked the horse .
Yes , well , it 's all good fun .
Wonderful !
He liked the <unk> , didn 't you ?
That kind of music should be <unk> by death .
<unk> !
<unk> sublime !
Well ?
Papa , the <unk> is you can only give <unk> that can be <unk> in the room .
What did he say ?
What did he say ?
Sssh !
Stay here .
<unk> !
Sssh !
My answer is no , Mozart .
Please .
I 'll give it back , I promise .
Please , sir .
I 'm sorry .
No .
No doubt , sir .
But I am <unk> with talent , and you with money .
If I offer mine , you should offer yours .
Well , this is hardly the way to go about it .
If a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
What for ?
Well .
Since it <unk> nobody is <unk> to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
What is this , Mozart ?
What 's the matter with you ?
Really ?
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my <unk> ?
Well , your pupil is married and living in <unk> , young man .
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
Herr Mozart .
What a surprise .
What can I do for you ?
Well , I 'm a good teacher .
The next time you wish me to <unk> another of your <unk> , please let me know .
Goodbye , Fraulein , goodbye , Madame !
goodbye , Sir !
It 's a miracle , Herr Mozart !
Well , yes !
on the whole .
I suppose .
How long have you been playing , Fraulein ?
Never mind , Strudel .
It 's part of music , getting used to an audience .
Aren 't I right , Herr Mozart ?
Strudel , this is Herr Mozart .
Say good morning .
Good morning , Fraulein <unk> .
Of course , it 's him .
Who do you think it is ?
I 'm afraid I am .
This is Herr Mozart , my dear .
The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude .
Where is she ?
Madame .
You won 't be <unk> this one either .
She 's my wife .
What ?
<unk> !
That 's funny - I like it .
Which one , eh ?
You 're a funny fellow .
<unk> !
Come this way .
And which one of them do you want me to teach ?
Quiet !
Quiet !
Quiet !
Down there , damn you .
Welcome to you .
Pay no attention , they 're impossible .
Stop it , you willful things !
Come this way .
Just ignore them .
They 're perfectly <unk> , just willful .
I treat them just like my own children .
I was foolish .
I thought you did not care for my work - or me .
Forgive me .
Forgive me !
What for ?
I am so ashamed .
I 'm not leaving you .
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little ?
I can keep going , I assure you .
Shall we try ?
We 'll stop for just a moment .
Then we 'll do the <unk> .
Oh no .
I 'm not tired at all .
Do you want to rest a bit ?
Then let me hear it .
All of it .
The whole thing from the beginning - now !
Yes .
Do you have it ?
You go fast !
And that 's it .
Do you have it ?
Yes !
Yes , and on ' <unk> ' .
Sopranos up to F on the second ' Voca ' ?
C Major .
Sopranos and <unk> in thirds .
<unk> on C. Sopranos above .
<unk> , vo-ca me , vo-ca me cum <unk> dic-tis .
Yes , yes - go on .
The Voca Me .
Suddenly sotto voce .
<unk> that down : sotto voce , <unk> .
Voca me cum <unk> .
Call me among the <unk> .
That 's wonderful !
Show me .
I think so .
Do you have me ?
Oh no .
Now for the Fire .
<unk> in <unk> - <unk> on all - like this .
And that 's all ?
Exactly .
The instruments to go with the voices .
<unk> and <unk> , tonic and dominant .
Also <unk> ?
With the tenors .
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what ?
It couldn 't be simpler .
Please !
Just one moment .
Now the <unk> .
Second bassoon and <unk> trombone with the <unk> .
<unk> notes and <unk> .
The first bassoon and tenor trombone - Fourth measure , second beat - <unk> Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis , <unk> <unk> a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis .
Yes .
Good .
Now the tenors .
Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis .
Second measure , fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis .
All right ?
<unk> it back .
I think so .
<unk> measure , second beat starting on <unk> Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis .
And fourth measure , fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis , <unk> a-cri-bus <unk> dic-tis .
Do you have that ?
Yes .
Start with the voices .
<unk> first .
Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis .
Second measure , second beat .
Ma-le-dic-tis .
<unk> , of course .
<unk> time .
What time ?
The Fire .
So now - A minor .
Suddenly .
Yes .
We ended in F Major ?
Confutatis Maledictis .
Come .
Let 's begin .
Strange !
Oh , yes .
A fire which never dies .
<unk> one forever ?
What ?
Do you believe in it ?
<unk> to <unk> of <unk> .
So now the Confutatis .
Confutatis Maledictis .
When the wicked are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
How would you <unk> that ?
The end of the <unk> - <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Where did I stop ?
A Mass .
A Mass for the Dead .
Then , let us try together .
I 'd <unk> it as such an honour .
Tell me , what is this work ?
You know , it 's all here in my head .
It 's just ready to be set down .
But when I 'm dizzy like this my eyes won 't focus .
I can 't write .
Of course .
But you 'd have to swear not to tell a soul .
I 'm not allowed .
My dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .
Would you ?
Actually , you could .
Yes .
Can I - could I help you , in any way ?
Another ?
But that 's too soon !
Tomorrow night ?
It 's impossible !
Did he say a hundred ?
He knows .
He knows !
Finish what ?
Wait !
Ask him if he 'd give me some money now .
Tell him if he would , that would help me finish it .
What man ?
The man .
He 's here .
Who ?
No !
No , it 's him !
Shall I answer it ?
I 'm too young to be so sick .
What ?
The doctor thinks I am .
But - Are you ill ?
I have bad <unk> .
I don 't sleep well anymore .
Then I drink too much , and think stupid things .
I do .
Do you mean that ?
Oh no .
It is a sublime piece .
The <unk> <unk> .
I tell you , you are the greatest composer known to me .
This is only a vaudeville .
I would never miss anything that you had written .
You must know that .
I mean to come to my opera .
You are the only <unk> who did .
No , please .
You 're so good to me .
Truly .
Thank you .
You mean she 's not coming back ?
Not here !
She 's not well , either .
She went to the <unk> .
Where is your wife ?
No , no .
I have to get back .
I have - I 'm taking you home .
You 're not well .
What happened ?
Is it over ?
No , no !
I promise you , I 'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can !
Are you <unk> my request ?
I don 't have it yet .
It 's not finished .
I 'm sorry , but I need more time .
Work fast .
And be sure to tell no one what you do .
You will see me again soon .
How long will you give me ?
How much ?
I am only a <unk> .
Do you accept ?
You will be paid well .
Who are you ?
A man who <unk> a Requiem Mass and never got one .
What dead ?
Who is dead ?
A Mass for the dead .
What work ?
I have come to commission work from you .
Oh no !
One hears such sounds and what can one say , but - Salieri !
You <unk> me .
I never knew that music like that was possible .
Yes ?
How could it not , Excellency ?
Did my work please you ?
How could I not ?
Mozart .
It was good of you to come .
Grazie , a <unk> , <unk> Antonio !
Grazie , <unk> caro , Wolfgang !
Oh no , the honour would be all mine .
I wouldn 't presume .
All the same , if it wouldn 't be <unk> , I would like you to see my new piece .
It would be a tremendous honour for me .
I know , I know .
Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .
I think you <unk> our dear Viennese , my friend .
Do you know you didn 't even give them a good <unk> at the end of songs so they knew when to <unk> ?
It 's the best opera yet written .
I know it !
Why didn 't they come ?
I think it 's marvelous .
Truly .
What did you think of it yourself ?
Did you like it at all ?
Well , I can speak for the Emperor .
You made too many demands on the royal ear .
The poor man can 't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four .
But what is it they don 't like ?
I know ; it 's outrageous .
Still , if the public doesn 't like one 's work one has to accept the fact <unk> .
Nine <unk> !
Nine !
That 's all it 's had - and <unk> .
Thank you !
Oh , thank you .
With all my heart , Mozart .
Oh , Excellency , would you ?
But there are those who have power over him .
I think I 'll take this up with the Emperor .
It 's not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
How <unk> .
Oh no !
My wife took it out in time .
You burned the score ?
Oh , I could kill him !
I mean really kill him .
I actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry !
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg ?
He 's obviously no friend of yours .
I don 't know .
They say I 've got to <unk> the opera , but it 's perfect as it is .
I can 't <unk> what 's perfect .
Can 't you talk to him ?
Really ?
Why ?
It 's <unk> !
The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music .
<unk> of it .
Wolfgang , what is it ?
<unk> <unk> , per <unk> .
What 's the matter ?
I don 't think you should become known in Vienna as a <unk> , Mozart .
However , I know a very <unk> gentleman I could recommend to you .
And he has a daughter .
Will that do ?
I can 't say .
Really What exactly are you working on ?
Two thousand , two hundred <unk> is all I need A hundred ?
Fifty ?
Forgive me .
We all have <unk> feelings of some kind .
Ah .
Italian ?
Cream cheese mixed with <unk> sugar and <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
Actually , it 's a big secret .
Oh , this is delicious !
What is it ?
Come , come , Mozart ; I 'm interested .
Truly .
I 'd better not .
It 's a bit of a secret .
Ah , how exciting !
Tell me more .
Well , could you <unk> me some money till you have one ?
Then I 'll teach her for free .
That 's a promise .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
I 'm being silly .
Papa 's right - I should put a <unk> on my mouth .
<unk> , is there any chance you could manage a loan ?
Only for six months , eight at most .
After that I 'll be the richest man in Vienna .
I 'll pay you back double .
Anything .
Name your <unk> .
I 'm not joking .
I 'm working on something that 's going to <unk> like a bomb all over Europe !
I 'm afraid not .
Do you have a daughter ?
Of course not .
They 're <unk> successful .
You can 't get a seat .
The only problem is none will hire me .
They all want to hear me play , but they won 't let me teach their daughters .
As if I was some kind of fiend .
I 'm not a fiend !
How is that possible ?
You give concerts , don 't you ?
I hear they are quite successful .
How can anyone say that ?
We have no cook , no maid .
We have no <unk> .
Nothing at all !
It has been said , my friend , that you are <unk> to live somewhat above your means .
No , but I 'm broke .
I 'm always broke .
I don 't know why .
You don 't mean to tell me you are living in <unk> ?
Look , I must have pupils .
Without pupils I can 't manage .
An <unk> idea .
<unk> you and me , no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth .
But I can 't lose this post , I simply can 't !
Excellency , please .
Let 's go to the palace , and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice .
He could actually do musical harm to the Princess !
No , no , no : he has yet to <unk> mediocrity .
Sommer ?
Herr Sommer ?
But the man 's a fool !
He 's a total mediocrity .
Herr Sommer .
<unk> did they choose ?
My dear Mozart , there is no one in the world I would rather help , but now it is too late .
<unk> ?
That 's impossible !
They haven 't even seen my work .
I need this post .
Please , can 't you help me ?
Please !
I have just come from the palace .
The post has been filled .
Why ?
Here is the music .
It 's here .
I am <unk> it <unk> .
Isn 't that what you wanted ?
Why didn 't you come to me yesterday , Mozart ?
This is a most painful situation .
Yesterday I could have helped you .
<unk> , I can 't .
So you see , this post is very important to me right now .
I 'm <unk> .
And congratulations to you , of course .
She is well .
She is - well , actually , I 'm about to become a father !
She only told me last night .
You are the first to know .
So you are .
How is your pretty wife ?
Your Excellency , you requested some specimens of my work .
Here they are .
I don 't have to tell you how much I need your help .
I truly appreciate your looking at these .
I have pressures on me - financial pressures .
As you know , I 'm a married man now .
Herr Mozart , what <unk> you here ?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today .
Don 't you agree ?
How could I not ?
Did you like it , then ?
Dear Mozart , my sincere congratulations .
But this is absurd !
Yes !
yes !
er , on the whole , yes , Majesty .
Ah , love !
Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that .
Love , Sire !
A funny little tune , but it <unk> some good things .
Ah !
<unk> caro <unk> .
Really ?
I know your work well , Signore .
Do you know I actually composed some <unk> on a melody of yours ?
Oh yes , certainly .
Certainly , Herr Director !
Can we see the scene with the music back , please ?
<unk> out what you should never have put in .
What are you doing , Herr Director ?
It is dangerous for you to <unk> His Majesty 's <unk> .
Give me your score , please .
But surely the Emperor didn 't mean to <unk> dancing when it 's part of the story .
Exactly .
A dance .
Yes , but this is not a ballet .
This is a dance at Figaro 's wedding .
Did you not know that His Majesty has <unk> <unk> ballet in his operas ?
Certainly , Herr Director .
Mozart !
Herr Mozart , may I have a word with you please .
Right away .
Just let me tell you how it begins .
That will do , Herr Mozart !
But , Your Majesty - What you think , Mozart , is <unk> the point .
It is what His Majesty thinks that counts .
Well not especially .
It can be in Turkish , if you really want .
I don 't care .
Then why especially does it have to be in German ?
Exactly .
You mean in Turkey ?
I think you 'd better .
I - I don 't think you have , Herr Director .
Not yet .
I mean , it 's quite n - Of course , I 'll show it to you immediately .
Oh ?
Have I seen it ?
May I just do that , Majesty ?
Show you how it begins ?
Just that ?
Herr Mozart - Must I ?
Well , I won 't !
I tell you straight : I will not !
Look , young man , the issue is simple .
If you want this post , you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues .
Show them one interesting <unk> and they <unk> .
<unk> !
Morbidezza !
Morbidezza !
Italians are musical <unk> and you want them to judge my music !
Mozart - They hate my music .
It <unk> them .
The only sound Italians understand is <unk> .
<unk> and dominant , tonic and dominant , from here to <unk> !
Ba-ba !
Ba-ba !
Ba-ba !
Ba-ba !
Anything else is <unk> .
Mozart - Naturally , the Italians !
Of course !
Always the Italians !
<unk> <unk> , Count <unk> <unk> and Court Composer Salieri .
Who is on this committee ?
A little <unk> would suit you better .
No , but I 'm the best .
Mozart , you are not the only composer in Vienna .
Then why doesn 't he simply <unk> me to the post ?
On the contrary .
Is the Emperor angry with me ?
Because His Majesty wishes it .
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ?
Just to teach a <unk> girl .
What is what ?
What is this , Herr Chamberlain ?
Because they do .
They go on forever - at least what they represent .
The eternal in us , not the <unk> .
Opera is here to <unk> us .
You and me , just as much as His Majesty .
Elevated ?
What does that mean ?
Elevated !
The only thing a man should <unk> is - oh , excuse me .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm stupid .
But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things !
Old dead legends !
How can we go on forever writing about <unk> and legends ?
Mozart , music is not the issue here .
No one <unk> your talent .
It is your judgment of <unk> that 's in question .
Even with the politics taken out , this thing would still remain a vulgar <unk> .
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish ?
Surely you can choose more elevated <unk> ?
Sire , only opera can do this .
In a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it 's just noise .
No one can understand a word .
But with music , with music you can have twenty <unk> all talking at once , and it 's not noise - it 's a perfect <unk> .
Isn 't that marvelous ?
Mozart - Baron !
Well done , Mozart .
Really quite fine .
Why not ?
It 's charming .
I mean , I don 't actually show <unk> <unk> their !
their !
It 's not <unk> !
It 's highly <unk> , Majesty .
It 's full of proper German <unk> .
I swear it .
Absolutely !
My dear fellow , the language is not finally the point .
Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?
Oh , German !
German !
Please let it be German .
I don 't think it was really decided , Director .
Don 't pity me .
Pity yourself .
You serve a wicked God .
He killed Mozart , not I.
Took him , <unk> him away , without pity .
He destroyed His <unk> rather than let a mediocrity like me get the <unk> share in his glory .
He doesn 't care .
Understand that .
God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He <unk> .
He broke Mozart in half when He 'd finished with him , and threw him away .
Like an old , worn out <unk> .
Oh my son , my poor son !
No , Father .
From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me .
Whenever they say Mozart with love , they 'll have to say Salieri with <unk> .
And that 's my <unk> - at last !
Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in <unk> .
At least it 's better than the total <unk> he 'd planned for me , your merciful God !
My son , why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer ?
Is that your <unk> ?
Is it ?
What difference does that make ?
But not his body .
I <unk> his life .
No , you didn 't !
I did .
Why ?
Why ?
Why ?
Why add to your misery by <unk> to murder ?
You didn 't kill him .
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing .
How does one do that ?
How does one kill a man ?
It 's one thing to dream about it .
It 's very different when you have to do it , with your own hands .
Yes .
His funeral - imagine it !
The <unk> , all Vienna sitting there .
His coffin , Mozart 's little coffin in the middle .
And suddenly in that silence , music .
A <unk> music <unk> out over them all , a great Mass of Death : Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart , composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri .
What <unk> !
What depth !
What passion in the music !
Salieri has been touched by God at last .
And God , forced to listen .
<unk> - <unk> to stop it .
I at the end , for once , laughing at Him .
Do you understand ?
Do you ?
What ?
Oh yes , yes , yes , yes , yes !
Always the same <unk> answers !
There is no God of <unk> , Father .
Just a God of torture .
I do not claim to <unk> the <unk> .
I treasure them .
As you should .
Oh ?
I thought you did so every day .
So speak now .
Answer me !
My son , no one can speak for God .
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him .
That 's His doing , isn 't it ?
He gave me that <unk> - then made me <unk> .
Why ?
Tell me that .
If He didn 't want me to serve Him with music , why <unk> the <unk> , like a lust in my body , then deny me the talent ?
Go on , tell me !
Speak for Him !
God 's ways are not yours .
And you are not here to question Him .
Offer him the <unk> of <unk> .
He will give you back the <unk> of eternal life .
He is all merciful .
That is all you need to know .
No ?
Was Mozart a good man ?
You cannot say that !
Yes , Father .
Yes !
So much for my <unk> of <unk> .
What did it matter ?
Good , patient , <unk> , <unk> - what did it matter ?
Had goodness made me a good composer ?
I realized it absolutely then - that moment : goodness is nothing in the furnace of art .
And I was nothing to God .
Every day .
Sometimes for hours I would pray !
Did you try ?
It was <unk> .
What was God up to ?
Here I was <unk> all my natural lust in order to deserve God 's <unk> and there was Mozart <unk> his in all directions - even though engaged to be married !
- and no <unk> at all !
Was it possible I was being <unk> ?
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense , no matter how painful ?
That was very possible .
All the same , why him ?
Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility ?
My heart was <unk> up with such hatred for that little man .
For the first time in my life I began to know really <unk> thoughts .
I couldn 't stop them .
He was murdered , Father !
Mozart !
<unk> murdered .
Do you hear me ?
Should I ?
Do you believe it ?
Is it true ?
And do they believe it ?
All Vienna has heard that .
Ah - you 've heard that ?
Of course .
The man you accuse yourself of killing .
I didn 't .
That was Mozart .
Wolfgang <unk> Mozart .
You know who that is ?
Oh , I know that !
That 's charming !
I didn 't know you wrote that .
Can you <unk> no melody of mine ?
I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy .
I wrote forty operas alone .
What about this little thing ?
I regret it is not too familiar .
Well ?
I 'm surprised you don 't know .
It was a very popular tune in its day .
I wrote it .
How about this ?
I can 't say I do .
What is it ?
Then you must know this .
Here in Vienna .
Where ?
I know a little .
I studied it in my <unk> .
How well are you trained in music ?
My son , there is something dreadful on your soul .
<unk> it to me .
I 'm here only for you .
Please talk to me .
I do not <unk> forgiveness .
Offer me your <unk> .
I can offer you God 's forgiveness .
Are they ?
That makes no difference .
All men are equal in God 's eyes .
Do you know who I am ?
You never heard of me , did you ?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
Leave me alone .
Do you understand that you have sinned ?
<unk> .
What do you want ?
In the sight of God that is a sin .
So ?
You tried to take your life .
You do remember that , don 't you ?
About what ?
I am Father <unk> .
I am a <unk> here .
I thought you might like to talk to someone .
What do you want ?
Yes , in the third act .
Yes , absolutely .
Is there a ballet in Figaro ?
Excuse me - didn 't His Majesty <unk> forbid ballet in his opera ?
<unk> ?
What ballet ?
About the ballet .
What <unk> ?
The Emperor has given him permission .
<unk> .
Well , Mozart is already <unk> .
Never mind .
Where ?
I 've seen the <unk> .
Are you absolutely sure ?
You must be mad .
Yes .
He 's setting that play to music ?
Exactly .
You mean that play ?
Italian ?
Mozart is writing a new opera .
An Italian opera .
Yes ?
I 've just learned something that might be of interest to you , Herr Director .
Ah .
Well , the play makes a hero out of a valet .
He <unk> his noble master and <unk> him as a <unk> .
Do you see the implications ?
This would be , in a <unk> situation , as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor .
Oh yes , yes .
And that was ?
For the same reason , Herr Chamberlain , that it was banned in France .
I know we banned this play , but frankly I can 't remember why .
Can you <unk> my memory , Herr Director ?
Did we ?
Well , actually , Sire , if you remember , we did finally <unk> to Italian .
Well done , Sire !
Bravo , Your Majesty !
Oh , I 'm tender enough for you , my boy .
I 'm tender enough for you .
Well , I don 't know !
I mean you 're a delicious , delightful , <unk> little <unk> , but don 't you think you might be just a little tough ?
Of course now .
Right away , before I get any older .
What do you mean - now ?
Well , promise then .
I can 't wait .
Now you 've got to promise me faithfully you 'll remain true to me forever .
Then you 'll see how <unk> your little birdie will love you .
Oh .
Well , thank you !
How wonderful .
Some people get all the luck .
I 've taken pity on you , my angel .
I heard your wish .
What ?
Who the devil are you ?
Here I am , my angel .
Indeed .
Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him .
A very appropriate person to do so .
Yes .
How sad .
It 's tragic , isn 't it ?
Such a talent .
No , Baron , no .
I 'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause .
He has managed to <unk> practically the whole of Vienna .
He is constantly drunk .
He never pays his <unk> .
I can 't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him .
Can 't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ?
I 've done my best .
I got him to arrange some <unk> for my Sunday concerts .
He got a <unk> - what I could afford .
Can 't you think of anyone who might do something for him ?
I agree , Baron .
This is <unk> , you know .
You <unk> Mozart to some of my friends and he 's <unk> from practically all of them .
It has to stop .
Come with me .
And stay in the room .
He didn 't say , sir .
I told him I didn 't know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .
What does he want ?
Show her in .
Then go to bed .
That lady is back , sir .
Excuse me , my dear .
She didn 't say .
But she says it 's urgent .
Who is she ?
Excuse me , sir , there is a lady who insists on talking to you .
Yes , indeed .
<unk> to you all now .
It was <unk> - truly !
Oh , by the way , give him this .
This is his share .
That should cheer him up , eh ?
Yes .
And congratulations to all of you .
It was <unk> .
I 'll call tomorrow .
Bene .
And say everything went <unk> .
A <unk> - say that !
Tell him the audience <unk> his name a hundred times .
Of course .
Well , tell him we were here , won 't you ?
Oh , yes .
He 's just exhausted .
He became dizzy , that 's all .
We should let him rest .
But he 's all right ?
Well , he 's sleeping now .
Better not .
Can we come in ?
Yes , I am looking after him .
Herr Salieri .
Thank you .
I 'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist !
I push things about , but I 've little say what happens to them .
You know , did he seem depressed ?
Do you think he 'll eat the food ?
What do you mean , ' how did he look ' ?
How did he look ?
The American ?
Yes , duck .
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his <unk> yet ?
I doubt it .
But it 's something to do .
David ?
Nurse Hobbs said there 's a disturbance in Leicester Square <unk> some sort of mad dog .
Tea would be nice .
What shall we do ?
I expect you shortly .
No , a cab will be faster .
Shall I send a car ?
He 's fine .
We 'll come right over .
You 're certain he 's lucid ?
You won 't need any help ?
Yes , Doctor .
Right .
Now listen carefully .
I want you to bring David here .
I want him in my care .
I 'll <unk> the police that we 've found him .
It is <unk> that you bring him straight to the hospital .
Do you understand ?
Yes , I should think so .
Could you get here without any trouble ?
No , not really .
Is David acting <unk> ?
No , why ?
Have you read the papers today ?
Have you listened to the radio or television ?
Yes , he is .
He 's very excited and confused , but he 's not crazy , if that 's what you mean .
The zoo ?
Is he rational ?
He doesn 't remember .
He woke up at the zoo .
Is he all right ?
Why didn 't you call me ?
Where was he ?
He 's here .
Let 's call the police and see if they can help us find our <unk> boy .
What shall we do ?
Oh , I don 't mean running about on all <unk> and <unk> at the moon .
But in such a <unk> state he could harm himself , or perhaps others .
Dr. Hirsch ?
David has suffered a severe <unk> .
I myself <unk> some form of mass <unk> in East Proctor .
If all the <unk> believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf , why shouldn 't David ?
And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf , wouldn 't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon ?
Surely you 're not suggesting ... No .
He knows no one in London , besides me .
I shouldn 't have left him alone .
You 've absolutely no idea where David might be ?
I think the <unk> of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret .
I 'm convinced that , like David , they believe in this werewolf .
And what else ?
They were lying .
There were no witnesses , no escaped lunatic .
The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there .
Yes .
I tried to investigate the attack .
There are no records .
The case was closed and now they 've ' <unk> ' the file .
David 's <unk> were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet <unk> no doctor <unk> him before I did .
The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he 's no good to us .
So I went to the <unk> in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things .
Dr. Hirsch , what 's wrong ?
Is this more serious than I know ?
Warn him ?
David says Jack comes to warn him .
What did he say ?
Yes .
Has his friend <unk> to him again ?
Well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend .
Alex , has David <unk> in his werewolf <unk> ?
He 's not ?
At my flat .
I 'm off at <unk> and ...
It 's a full moon .
Where is he ?
Yes , sir .
Oh dear girl , your <unk> activities are of no <unk> to me .
I don 't give a damn who you sleep with .
I 'm concerned about David .
Come to my office , Miss Price .
It 's all right , Susan .
Yes , Doctor , I have .
Yes , I believe he did .
Did he say a wolf ?
No , sir .
Of course , sir .
Good day , Doctor .
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them .
He must have been a very powerful man .
Although I really don 't see that it is any of your concern , Miss Price .
What happened to them ?
That would be Jack Goodman , the boy who was killed .
He said ' Jack ' .
What exactly did he call out ?
Yes , Doctor ?
Oh , Miss Price ?
Yes , Doctor .
Go about your <unk> .
Dr. Hirsch ?
Can I be of service , Miss Price ?
Miss <unk> , surely you must <unk> some function here at the hospital .
Dr. Hirsch , Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago .
Control ! ? !
What control ! ? !
Get away from me !
David , don 't lose control .
Leave me alone , dammit !
You people are crazy !
I 've got to get away from here !
I 've got to do something !
David , let 's go now .
<unk> .
It 's hopeless .
Will you shut up ! ? ! !
Sir , he 's very upset .
His friend was killed and ...
I swear , I don 't know this girl .
We had an argument .
He 's being silly .
What ?
He 's playing a stupid joke , sir .
<unk> ! ? !
I 'm a fucking werewolf , for Christ 's sake !
David , please be rational .
Let 's go to Dr. Hirsch .
Jack is dead .
Look , six people have been killed .
I 'm going to the police .
Jack is dead !
I am going to the cops .
There 's a full moon tonight .
Jack was right .
I ... David , stop !
Six people <unk> ?
It had to be me , Alex .
David , what are you doing ?
Pull over .
But ...
I don 't know why I feel so good .
I haven 't felt this good in a long time .
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do .
I should be committed .
The next corner we can get a cab .
I said goodbye to you .
I was locked out of the flat .
I <unk> the wall and came in through the bathroom window .
I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo !
I guess I am out of my fucking mind .
Don 't you remember ?
<unk> up at the zoo , that 's not so insane .
Having no clothes on ?
That 's insane .
What did I do last night , Alex ?
The zoo ?
Alex , I 've lost my mind .
I woke up at the zoo !
But you know what ?
I feel terrific !
I 'm freezing .
David !
Where on earth have you been ! ? !
See you later .
I 'm off .
There 's food in the <unk> .
A <unk> werewolf .
I 've left those pills for you .
Okay .
Listen , if you get too anxious , call me at the hospital , okay ?
Yeah , I do , but go to work .
David , do you want me to stay here tonight ?
<unk> simply do not exist .
It 's silly of you to be apprehensive .
Tell me that it 's silly of me to be apprehensive .
Anything .
Do me an <unk> favor ?
Let me go now , you 'll make me late .
That 's good , Alex .
<unk> me .
Tomorrow is the full moon .
I wasn 't <unk> .
But , David .
I was awake and he was in my room .
David , you don 't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack <unk> from the grave to breakfast with you ?
Do you really ?
Good .
Of course .
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
Yes ?
Alex ?
It 's nice to see you .
It 's nice to see you .
David , perhaps you 'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower .
There is only one bed .
The bedroom .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
Closet .
Very nice .
The kitchen .
Yeah , I would think so , too .
I would think so .
I was dreaming again ?
What do I think ?
You mean about the <unk> of your becoming a monster in two days or about <unk> from dead friends ?
Yeah .
He says that I will become a monster in two days .
What do you think ?
Your dead friend Jack ?
My friend Jack was just here .
You 're to be discharged tomorrow .
Will you be all right ?
I 'll let you know the next full moon .
Are you better now ?
A werewolf ?
I 'm a werewolf .
Good .
I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room .
Now I 'm embarrassed .
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then ?
Forgive me , I 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it .
You 're being awfully forward , aren 't you ?
Not just a patient -- me .
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ?
Will you think about it ?
Now , David , I said I would keep you company , but I meant right here and now .
I 'm serious .
You don 't know me and I know nothing about you .
We have a perfect relationship .
What ?
Will you come with me ?
David , your dreams will stop .
You 'll leave England and your bad memories ; and then this will all fade away .
I keep having these really terrible dreams .
They are getting worse and I can 't seem to stop them .
That 's easy enough .
No , thank you .
Just keep me company for a while .
Don 't be silly .
Can I get you something ?
I 'm sorry I woke you up .
Hello .
You all right ?
Ahem , A Word of Explanation .
It was in <unk> <unk> that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about .
He <unk> me by three things : his <unk> <unk> , his marvelous <unk> with ancient <unk> , and the <unk> of his company - for he did all the talking .
We fell together as <unk> people will in the <unk> of the <unk> ...
Yes , go on .
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court by <unk> L. Clemens .
This is after the <unk> but before chapter one : A Word of Explanation .
You all right ?
What ?
Oh , yes , please .
Shall I read to you ?
My best friend .
My very best friend .
Was Jack Goodman your good friend ?
Now what do you want to talk about ?
I know .
I 'm twenty-seven .
<unk> .
How old are you ?
That 's not really a very proper question .
How old are you ?
It 's okay .
I want to talk to you .
I 'm sorry .
I shouldn 't have asked you .
I dream of death mostly .
What do you dream about ?
I 've just started it .
My friend gave it to me .
Do you like it ?
<unk> Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ' by Mark <unk> .
I was .
What are you reading ?
I thought you were asleep .
You 're a very beautiful girl .
Will you give me a break ?
Let 's try a little harder , shall we ?
Right .
This is absurd .
I 'm not hungry .
I don 't want any food .
Shall I be forced to feed you , David ?
Call me David .
Shall I be forced to feed you , Mr. Kessler ?
Aw come on , Alex !
Call me Alex .
Aw come on , Miss Price !
Sorry .
Leave the pills .
I 'll take them later .
Well , you 're to take these after you 've eaten .
Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?
How is that ?
You put me in an <unk> position , Mr. Kessler .
Please , really .
I 'm not hungry .
I 'm afraid you have to eat something .
I 'm not very hungry , thank you .
You haven 't eaten your lunch .
Yes ?
Mr. Kessler ?
A wolf .
What ?
It was a wolf .
I beg your pardon ?
It wasn 't a lunatic .
I thought not .
No .
Benjamin , have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ?
No !
No what ?
No .
How are we feeling tonight ?
Right .
No .
The doctor will be round later .
Would you like a picture book to look at ?
We have some lovely funny <unk> .
No .
Feeling better ?
No .
Well , all right then , be that way .
Here , swallow this .
No .
No what ?
No .
Hello , Benjamin .
Really , Susan , I don 't think that was very proper , and besides , it 's common practice now .
I looked .
Why on earth do you say that ?
I think he 's a Jew .
<unk> says he 's from New York .
He 's an American , you know .
Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those <unk> <unk> to see him .
Yes , I should think .
He called out just now .
He all right ?
Yes , Mrs. Hobbs .
Nothing quite as <unk> as that , Miss Price .
He just doesn 't eat enough of what is put before him .
He <unk> from nightmares .
I 'd think he just needs a hand to hold .
Has he been <unk> food ?
Take these round now , will you please ?
The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he 's eaten .
Will you be sure of that ?
Yes , Mrs. Hobbs .
Miss Price .
That 's what I want you to do , you moron !
You 're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you .
Who is this girl ?
Shakespeare was French !
The Queen Mother sucks <unk> in hell !
Shit !
Fuck !
<unk> !
Now see here young man .
Queen Elizabeth is a man !
Prince Charles is a faggot !
<unk> <unk> was full of shit !
There 's no call for that kind of language .
Hey , you asshole !
I want you to arrest me !
All right , you two , move along .
You did , did you ?
Officer , I killed those people last night .
Why are you doing this to me ?
No , David .
Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead .
The undead .
That 's easy for you to say - you 're already dead .
You 've left my wife a widow and my children <unk> .
And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf 's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted .
Mr. Bringsly , I 'm sorry .
I have absolutely no idea what to say to you .
This isn 't Mr. Goodman 's idea .
He is your good friend , <unk> I am a victim of your <unk> lunar activities .
Why are you doing this to me , Jack ?
You could have told them !
No one brought them here !
No one wanted them here !
That 's very funny , that is .
Oh , all right .
There was this airplane over the <unk> on its way to New York .
It was full of men from the United <unk> .
No .
You 've had your chance .
Oh , come on , tell us .
All right , laugh then .
I <unk> 't tell it .
Quiet , everyone !
Hush !
<unk> !
You be quiet , woman , and let me speak .
No , but we 're about to .
Here , <unk> , Tom .
Did you hear the one about the <unk> plane ?
Bambi ?
Yes , but does everyone kill Bambi ?
Some , everyone does .
Do you have bad dreams , too ?
An American film about the Mafia called ' See You Next <unk> ' , and I want to see it badly , so you give me no problems and go to sleep .
What are you going to see ?
Miss Price , the other nurse that <unk> you .
Alex ?
It 's nearly eight .
I 'm off duty shortly , then I 'm off to the films with Alex .
What time is it ?
Now go back to sleep so you 'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning .
I was having a nightmare .
Mr. Kessler ?
Wake up , please .
Of course not , David .
I 'll fetch in young Miss Price .
Dr. Hirsch ?
I 'd rather not be by myself .
Believe me .
The Hound of the Baskervilles was an <unk> of Sir Arthur <unk> <unk> 's .
And if you 'd read the bloody book , you 'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a <unk> , a fake .
You really think I 'm crazy , don 't you ?
David , please .
The police are satisfied .
I 'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we 'd have seen it on the telly .
Then why the hell are you so quick to <unk> me ?
You yourself said it must have taken <unk> strength to tear apart a person like that .
I really don 't know .
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor ?
Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb ?
No .
In fact , your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here .
Did you see Jack ?
You 'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of .
Look , Dr. Hirsch , I know I 've been <unk> , but Jack was torn apart .
I saw him .
A man can 't do that to someone with his <unk> hands .
Yes .
I 've told you , it wasn 't a man .
It was an animal .
A big wolf or something .
A <unk> dog .
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you ?
Sure , as a kid .
But never so real .
Never so <unk> .
You 've never had bad dreams before ?
Doctor , my memory is fine .
It 's my sanity I 'm beginning to worry about .
In time I 'm sure it will all come back to you .
How could there have been witnesses ?
It was so dark .
We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere ...
I don 't understand what they 're talking about .
So they said .
There were witnesses ?
Now we 've just given you a pretty strong <unk> , so try to get some rest now .
Miss Price will see to your needs .
<unk> now .
<unk> ?
You 've suffered some rather severe cuts and <unk> , lost a bit of blood , but nothing too serious ; black and blue for a while .
You 'll have some <unk> <unk> to <unk> of .
That lunatic must have been a very <unk> fellow .
They say a mad man has the strength of ten .
Two weeks ?
You 've been <unk> since you were brought in two weeks ago .
How long have I been here ?
Get your fucking hands off me !
What the hell is going on here ?
Miss Price !
Miss Price , please !
Now , David , I want you to prepare yourself ; your friend is dead .
The guy I was with .
Is he all right ?
How did I get to London ?
I should think so after your <unk> <unk> experiences .
London ?
Where 's Jack ?
I had a strange dream .
You 're in a hospital in London .
Where am I ?
Hello , David .
I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a <unk> of yours , Mr. <unk> .
If you did it wrong , it would be painful .
You 'd <unk> to death .
I could hang myself .
How shall I do it ?
Because this must be stopped .
Gerald is the man you murdered in the <unk> .
We thought it best you didn 't see him as he 's a fresh kill and still pretty <unk> .
Hello .
David Kessler , this is Gerald Bringsly .
I want you to meet some people .
Well , even if I 'm not the <unk> , I am crazy enough to do something like that .
I mean , here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse .
I 'm glad to see you , Jack .
What about the zoo ?
I didn 't mean it .
I don 't know what I 'm saying .
I 'm not even sure it was me who killed those people .
I don 't remember doing it .
Thank you .
You look awful .
If I was still alive , I probably would .
Aren 't you going to say , ' I told you so ' ?
You don 't have to say anything .
What can I say , Jack ?
Hi , David .
Hi , Jack .
I will not accept this !
Now go away !
The <unk> will be real .
You 'll taste real blood !
God damit , David , please believe me !
You 'll kill and make others like me !
I 'm not having a nice time , David !
Don 't allow this to happen again !
You must take your own life !
What , Jack ?
That tomorrow night <unk> the full moon I 'll <unk> hair and <unk> and eat people ?
Bullshit !
You must believe me .
I think I 've lost my mind .
I think you 're not real .
I think I 'm asleep and you 're a part of another bad dream .
What do you think ?
Jack , are you really dead ?
You must take your own life now , David , before it 's too late .
A monster .
I know , I know .
David , tomorrow night is the full moon .
You 'll change , you 'll become ... Get out of here , Jack !
Yes .
I understand all right .
You 're one of the undead and I 'm a werewolf .
David , I 'm sorry I upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on .
Okay , you 've seen me .
Now go away .
I wanted to see you .
What are you doing here ?
Don 't be an asshole , David .
Come here .
You 're not real .
It 's cold , David , and I 'm so alone .
The undead <unk> me .
Have you ever talked to a corpse ?
It 's boring !
I 'm lonely !
Kill yourself , David , before you kill others .
Nurse !
Oh God !
Alex !
The supernatural !
The <unk> of <unk> !
It 's all true .
Take your own life !
<unk> , David .
Join me .
Nurse !
Listen to me !
Take your own life , David .
It 's our only chance .
Nurse !
David , please believe me .
You will kill people , David .
You 've got to stop the <unk> before it begins .
You 're talking like <unk> <unk> !
It 's movie <unk> !
You 'll <unk> the streets of London a creature of the night .
Jack , please go away .
Please go away .
Beware the moon .
The full moon , David .
You 've got two days .
Stop it , Jack .
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said ?
<unk> the moon . '
What are you talking about ?
I won 't accept this !
Get out !
God damit !
You survived and now you shall <unk> the curse .
What ? !
It 's you , David .
Will you be quiet ? !
The wolf 's bloodline must be severed .
The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed .
What 's wrong with you ?
Shut up !
I was murdered , an <unk> death , and now I walk the earth in <unk> until the werewolf 's curse is lifted .
Shut up , you <unk> !
On the moors , we were attacked by a <unk> , a werewolf .
I 'm not listening !
We were attacked by a werewolf .
If you love me so much , Jack , you 'll realize how <unk> it is to share one 's breakfast with the living dead !
I 'm a <unk> sight , it 's true ; but I love you and that 's why I 'm here .
You 've got to know .
Warn me ?
Will you get out of here , you meat <unk> ?
David , now I know this may be hard for you , but I have to warn you .
What ? !
David !
I 'm going completely crazy .
Life <unk> me even in death .
Rudy Levine the <unk> ?
So you know what she does ?
She 's so grief <unk> she runs to find <unk> in Rudy Levine 's bed .
I can 't stand it .
Debbie Klein cried a lot .
Why should you be surprised ?
You were a very <unk> person .
Yeah .
Your parents came to my funeral .
I was surprised at how many people came .
Aren 't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace ?
I 'm sorry to be upsetting you , David , but I had to come .
<unk> your feelings ?
Has it occurred to you that it may be <unk> to have you rise from your grave to visit me ?
Listen to me , I 'm talking to a hamburger !
David !
You 're hurting my feelings .
I 'm aware that I don 't look so great , but I thought you 'd be glad to see me .
This is too much .
I can 't handle this .
Thanks a lot .
Get the fuck out of here , Jack .
Nice to see you .
Are you going to help me up ?
You really scared me , you shithead .
Well .
I 'm glad we ...
<unk> ! !
I 'll tell you when we get there .
Where are we going ?
Yeah .
Jack ?
Not far enough .
Come on .
It sounds far away .
No .
See anything ?
<unk> away , yes , sir .
Here we are walking away .
<unk> away , Jack .
Nice <unk> .
Good boy .
A <unk> dog or something .
Turn slowly and let 's walk away .
Oh shit .
What is that ?
Do you think it 's a dog ?
It 's in front of us .
Let 's just keep walking .
<unk> ?
What 's the plan ?
It 's <unk> us .
It 's moving .
Anywhere !
I think we should just keep moving .
Come on , where ?
I don 't know .
Come on .
Shit !
David , what is that ?
Yeah .
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb .
It 's a full moon , ' <unk> the moon ' .
No , but he was on the moors .
Heathcliffe didn 't <unk> .
Heathcliffe .
<unk> Bill .
The Hound of the Baskervilles .
There aren 't any <unk> in England .
A <unk> .
Yeah ?
Could be a lot of things .
What was it ?
I heard that .
Did you hear that ?
I 'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you .
Say , David ...
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it , because they felt so silly .
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural .
I have no idea .
What do you think was wrong ?
Well , not quite a blood-thirsty mob .
I don 't know .
Now that we 're out here and it 's three degrees , I 'm not so sure I wouldn 't rather face a blood-thirsty mob .
That was weird .
I guess leaving was the best idea .
Come on , I 'm freezing .
Beware the moon ?
I don 't know .
Let 's see if there 's an <unk> or something up the road .
What the hell was that all about ?
Apparently so .
Come on , Jack , shall we go ? ! !
What do you mean ?
I 'm starving .
Jack , we 'd better go .
You ask them .
Go on , ask them .
<unk> .
Right .
I see .
You want me to ask these people if they 're burning candles to ward off monsters .
Listen , that 's a pentangle , a <unk> <unk> star .
It 's used in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> maintain it 's the <unk> of the wolf man .
You ask them .
Ask them what the candles are for .
Maybe the <unk> are from <unk> .
It 's a <unk> star .
What about it ?
Look at that .
Listen , at least it 's warm in here .
Nice looking group .
Nice to see you .
Hello .
Shall we ?
Okay .
I assume full responsibility .
David , before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it 's your fault .
A severed wolf 's head on a pike as their symbol .
That 's not a spear .
It 's a pike .
Of course , The Slaughtered Lamb .
Why else would they have a severed wolf 's head on a spear as their symbol ?
That 's a wolf 's head .
Of course , The Slaughtered Lamb .
Why else would they have a severed <unk> head on a spear as their symbol ?
The Slaughtered Lamb ?
She says she ' likes me too much ' .
We 've known Debbie what , since the <unk> grade ?
How many years of <unk> is that ?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
It just <unk> me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull .
I have to make love to her .
It 's very simple .
She has no choice really .
If you don 't stop , I 'm going to kill you .
<unk> in Rome <unk> Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein .
The love affair that <unk> Europe !
See <unk> <unk> at its most <unk> !
See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred <unk> of the <unk> !
Never has the screen <unk> ...
I don 't know .
Well , anyway , do you think she 'll be there ?
I 'm talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break .
You 're talking about the woman I love .
She 's a jerk .
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time .
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body .
Do you think she 'll meet me in Rome ?
Right .
I 'm sorry .
<unk> England first , Italy later .
Well , I like it here .
Oh , I don 't know .
I mean look around .
Isn 't this a fun place ?
You 're not having a good time are you ?
David .
Jack .
Good .
Yes .
Are you cold ?
Stay here .
If we need you , we 'll know where to <unk> you .
What can we do to assist you ?
<unk> of what you think , Lieutenant , the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him .
The <unk> <unk> seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved , that 's true , but I hardly think ... Why don 't we ask him ?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors ?
You were saying ?
Well , then , what can I do for <unk> <unk> ?
No , thank you , Doctor .
Come in , come in .
Please sit .
Some tea ?
Dr. Hirsch ?
Tell him I 'm out .
No , tell him I 've passed away .
An old war wound or something .
Tell him I 'm dead .
And no more calls !
He 's on the telephone .
What here ?
Roger <unk> , Doctor .
Excuse me .
Yes ?
Send them in .
<unk> <unk> and Sgt.
McManus are here to see you , Doctor .
Yes ?
I see .
You 've heard nothing about the incident ?
Oh , that 's been there for two hundred years .
We were going to paint it out , but it 's <unk> , so we left it .
What 's that ?
I suppose <unk> will <unk> .
Sorry , love .
<unk> and soda would do nicely .
Hello , there .
What can I get you ?
I beg your pardon ?
Remember the <unk> ?
But I can heat some up for you if you 'd like .
Oh .
No .
Then you have some hot tea ?
We 've got <unk> and beer .
If it 's something hot you want , you can have tea .
Hot chocolate ?
No .
Do you have any hot soup ?
We 'll find him , not to worry .
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night 's murders .
We will find him , however .
I can assure you of that .
That is precisely my point .
David , as far as we are concerned , the matter is closed .
We won 't trouble you any further .
Good day .
I don 't <unk> know , sir .
And what , Sergeant ?
Lieutenant , the boy seems pretty lucid to me and ... Sgt.
McManus , are you suggesting that David and Jack were , in fact , attacked by some animal and that the <unk> of East Proctor has <unk> to keep it a secret ?
We have an <unk> report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police .
We have two witnesses to the crime .
You 'll forgive me , Mr. Kessler , if I consider your <unk> as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock .
He may have a point , Lieutenant .
Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man .
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors ?
Sorry .
I 'd like some tea , please .
No , thank you .
Yeah - sure !
Yes - sure If she can 't pay , I 'll have to <unk> , won 't I ?
Why not ?
She 's a widow .
I don 't like taking mortgages from <unk> .
What 's the idea of turning her down ?
It sounds like a perfectly safe <unk> .
But listen , Tom , I I 'll tell you why .
I don 't like the crowd you 're mixed up with .
Personally , you can have all the credit you want .
But for that deal - not a <unk> .
Tom , I never had trouble getting credit from you before .
When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted .
Now I come to you with a swell deal , and the greatest I want to know why .
Listen , I told you I wasn 't interested in that deal , didn 't I ?
What do you suppose anybody wants ?
Money , money , money !
You here again ?
What do you want ?
Hello , Tom .
Yeah .
He has ?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson 's office .
Yeah .
He 'll have a tough time thinking up a <unk> for this one .
.
.
Matt ?
Where 's Matt ?
No kidding .
When I saw it , you could 'a knocked me over with a pin .
No kidding ?
I was the first one to see it .
I was coming down the stairs , and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .
<unk> , what 's the matter ?
Say , don 't <unk> me .
I got troubles of my own .
And listen , wise guy - I 'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o 'clock , so no <unk> out of you guys in the morning .
Yeah .
I remember once when your account checked .
I 'm fourteen cents out , and it took me half an hour to find the mistake .
And me with a date , too .
What 's the matter , Charlie ?
Where do you think I 've been ?
I took the baby for a <unk> in the park .
Where you been ?
Aw , <unk> !
Say pal , did you ever hear of a <unk> ?
It 'll be yours if you don 't kick in with that ten bucks .
Whose death ?
Baby , I can 't give you anything but love ...
I 'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will .
Give a guy a break , will you ?
I 've got to get it back in my account .
If Helen ever finds out that I Yeah ?
Charlie !
Ten bucks ?
Say , if I had ten bucks , I 'd quit .
Let me have ten bucks ?
Yeah .
Say , do me a favor , will you Charlie ?
Here 's twenty-five thousand .
Yeah .
It was more than that last week .
About twenty-four thousand .
How much ?
Say Matt , I 'll have to have some money for those <unk> payrolls .
Yes , sir .
And tell him not to delay .
Yes , sir .
When he comes in , tell him we 're waiting for him in the board room .
Not yet , Mr. Clark .
Mr. Dickson in yet ?
All right , let him !
I 'm sick and tired of hearing about him .
If he wants to run the bank , let him do it .
I don 't want any part of it .
You know Dickson as well as we do .
He 'll shut the doors before he gives up control .
Take it easy , Clark .
How are you protecting your depositors ?
By making a lot of <unk> loans !
What good will that do ?
Why , it will take control away from him .
We 'll put somebody else in charge , call in all <unk> loans , and be on safe ground again .
That 's what good it will do !
What good will that do ?
Dickson doesn 't have to go .
But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust Don 't make me laugh , <unk> !
Oh , is he ?
We carry more <unk> paper than any other institution in the city .
We 're fools to tolerate it .
Personally , I think you 're getting panic-stricken about nothing .
Dickson 's all right .
You know what you can do with that !
Come on , take a look at this !
You 'll see a <unk> of faith that 's worth more than all the <unk> in the world .
We 've been waiting fifteen minutes Come out here you <unk> - take a look at this !
The bank .
All right .
Do anything you want with it .
Dickson , I 'd like to talk to you about the bank .
I can 't ?
You just wait and see .
If that run doesn 't stop within the next hour , I 'll shut the doors .
You know what that means ?
The bank <unk> will step in tomorrow .
You 'll be forced to <unk> .
I 'll insist upon it .
The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar .
What 's left you gentlemen can have .
But I 'll guarantee there won 't be enough to pay your next month 's garage bill .
Say , you can 't do that So , that 's it , eh ?
You 've waited a long time for this chance , haven 't you ?
Well , I 'm not going to resign now - or ever .
No .
You can 't reason with anyone else when you 're in a jam .
We <unk> with you to keep liquid , but you wouldn 't listen to us .
You <unk> to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish .
Now you want our help .
You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you 've <unk> .
All right .
There 's one way you can get it .
Give us an <unk> on your stock and resign as president .
Aw , they 've gone crazy .
You can 't reason with a mob .
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to <unk> on you .
You thought they were your friends .
Why don 't you go out there now and try and get some help from them ?
I have everything I own in it .
It 's your bank as well as mine , isn 't it ?
That sounds very simple , Dickson , but why should we jeopardize our personal <unk> ?
I know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city .
Get that money over here and I 'll stop this run within five minutes .
What do you mean , help ?
We 'll be forced to shut the doors .
I 've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive .
You 've all made money out of it .
Are you willing to help ?
We 'll discuss that in the board room .
What about ?
We want to talk to you .
Yes !
You said it , Clark .
That 's the only thing that means anything to me .
Gentlemen , you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes .
He refuses an offer to <unk> with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground .
He insists upon running a bank on so <unk> a thing as .
.
.
as faith !
I 'm running this bank my way .
Get that clear !
I know , Dickson .
That 's all very well .
But you 're taking too many chances .
In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble .
In case of emergency !
Most of the creditors I know personally .
I 've seen them grow up in the community .
I knew their fathers and mothers before them .
Not at all .
That 's <unk> <unk> 's idea [ 5 ] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known .
Those are his <unk> words , gentlemen .
Character !
It 's the only thing you can bank on , and it 's the only thing that will pull this country out of the <unk> .
Character , <unk> !
That 's your idea ?
Just pure luck !
What 's the matter with my policy ?
How many <unk> has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years ?
I 'll tell you .
Not a single one !
What 's wrong with that kind of banking ?
Oh , you would , eh ?
All right .
If it 's more important than golf , go ahead .
What 's on your mind ?
I think , Mr. Dickson , we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning , if you don 't mind .
Say , you know , I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball .
You 've got to hit with the left hand , and from the inside out , it 's the only way you can hit anything He won 't believe it , Mr. Dickson .
But it 's the truth - honest it is .
I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she <unk> he was there with a married woman .
Doesn 't want to mention her name .
I didn 't kill him !
I had nothing to do with that , I tell you !
I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it !
Don 't forget there 's a dead watchman downstairs .
I was crazy , I tell you , Mr. Dickson .
I didn 't know what I was doing .
I wandered around in a <unk> .
All I could think of was that they were going to kill me .
.
.
You 'll stand by me , won 't you , Mr. Dickson ?
You won 't go back on me now , will you ?
I 'll die if they send me to prison !
They took my keys yesterday .
I went there to get them back .
What were you doing at Finlay 's this morning ?
Stand back , Inspector .
Let me out of here , or I 'll shoot you !
Don 't be a fool , Cluett .
This is only going to make it worse for you .
All right , Jack , all right .
Stand back Inspector , or I 'll shoot .
<unk> that gun .
It 's one of the boys from headquarters .
He always <unk> " Mother Machree " whenever he 's got good news .
Looks like this case 'll be settled in no time .
Somebody must be in good <unk> .
He was <unk> " Mother Machree . "
Thanks .
Why , of course .
You understand ?
Oh !
If you don 't mind , Inspector , I 'd rather not say - that is , unless it becomes absolutely <unk> .
You see , she 's married .
Looks like you 're going to have no trouble at all .
What was the lady 's name , Mr. Cluett ?
Oh yes , of course .
There was someone with me .
A lady .
That is simple , isn 't it ?
I assume you can prove that if necessary .
That 's very simple .
I was home .
Where were you at twelve o 'clock last night ?
Of course , yes .
Just what would you like to know , Inspector ?
I hope you don 't mind me asking you a few questions , Mr. Cluett .
Get out , get out !
She wasn 't to blame , Mr. Dickson .
It wasn 't her fault .
Honest , it wasn 't .
I <unk> her to come up .
She didn 't She just came up for a drink .
Just for a few minutes .
You just mentioned her name .
What was she doing there ?
What was she doing in your apartment ?
Nothing , nothing , Mr. Dickson .
Don 't pay any attention to me .
I don 't know what I 'm saying .
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night ?
But I didn 't kill that man last night .
Honest I didn 't , Mr. Dickson !
Fifty thousand dollars !
<unk> - I owed them a lot of money .
Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars !
What happened ?
You 're not a <unk> .
How 'd you get mixed up with these kind of people ?
I don 't know .
It 's all been like a crazy nightmare , Mr. Dickson .
<unk> !
Cluett , in heaven 's name , what got into you ?
Listen , buddy , you 're getting by pretty easy .
Quit <unk> !
But Dude , listen - couldn 't we make this some other time ?
Be sure you 're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked .
Understand ?
know , but You ?
No , you 'll be all right , so long as you <unk> an alibi for tonight .
Dude - there 's not any chance of my becoming involved in this , is there ?
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we 'll do the rest , see ?
What do you mean ?
You don 't have to do nothing .
Why , I couldn 't do that .
.
.
!
Why not ?
Good <unk> , man !
You 're not suggesting that I We can take blood from anything If it 's comin ' to us .
But after all , you can 't take blood from a stone .
That don 't do us any good .
I 'm sorry , Dude , <unk> Then what did you want to <unk> for ?
If you 'd have beat us out of fifty <unk> 's , you 'd have been paid , wouldn 't you ?
Well , we want our <unk> .
I haven 't got it .
That 's your funeral .
We 've got fifty thousand dollars comin ' to us .
I know , I know , Dude .
Oh , I must have been crazy !
I lost my head completely !
You know what we do to <unk> , Cluett , don 't you ?
What are you doing here ?
Why , Matt !
I 'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here .
I 'm not afraid of you .
You haven 't got a moustache !
And now fair woman , I have you in my power .
A misunderstood bachelor .
What is that , Mr.
<unk> ?
[ 7 ] Oh , you 're not so badly off .
There 's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
You know , there ought to be a Congressional <unk> for men like you .
America 's <unk> to misunderstood wives .
I never thought I would find myself in that class .
Good for you .
Come on .
No .
No , I 'm afraid papa isn 't that much interested .
He 's too busy <unk> off to Philadelphia to make stuffy , old <unk> at stuffy , old <unk> ' meetings .
Too busy closing big , important <unk> I think I will have a drink .
What 's the matter ?
<unk> papa will <unk> ?
No .
I know the answer to that one .
I think you 'd better take me home .
Come on up for just a few minutes .
We 'll have just one drink , then we 'll go .
I knew I couldn 't trust you .
You told me you were taking me home .
My apartment .
What 's this ?
Cyril !
No .
No , I 'm not .
I deliberately avoided you .
I was afraid of making a fool of myself .
But I won 't stand it any longer Why , Cyril , you 're insane I 've loved you ever since I can remember , long before you married Tom Dickson .
Now wait a minute , wait a minute ... Don 't you know I 've been crazy about you for years ?
What ?
I want to be near you !
No .
Don 't you know ?
Why are you so anxious ?
No , they won 't .
Not when you are there .
Oh , please , be a <unk> .
Please ask me .
Don 't be silly , Cyril .
These are respectable people .
They 'd probably bore you to death .
Now Phyllis , if you don 't invite me , I 'm coming anyway .
You ?
No can do .
It 's all set .
Just a few of Tom 's <unk> friends .
Well , aren 't you going to invite me ?
Well , what ?
Well But I 'm giving a party for him - a real , <unk> surprise party .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and everything .
I 'm really terribly excited about it .
I 've been planning it for months .
Please , please don 't laugh at me , Phyllis .
I must see you tonight !
Oh !
Oh , no !
I think I 've done enough <unk> for one day .
Congratulations , Cyril .
You 've convinced me that you 're a <unk> of the very first order .
I shall recommend you highly .
See , we 're getting along <unk> !
Yes , yes , it does .
What are you doing tonight , Phyllis ?
Doesn 't that come next ?
Now let me see , what comes next ?
Oh yes , I know - what are you doing tonight , Phyllis ?
But you see , it isn 't blarney where you 're concerned .
Come on Cyril , try a little bit of it out on me .
I haven 't had any <unk> blarney thrown at me since the day I was married .
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women .
<unk> ?
Not bad , not bad at all .
Do you know something ?
I 've always been curious about your line .
If I thought you were the <unk> bit interested , I would .
running around .
Not your work .
You 'd better start <unk> , Cyril !
What is ?
Here , here , here , now !
Don 't you go back to work on me , too .
I 'm getting tired of this .
Besides , it 's beginning to <unk> your looks <unk> !
You 're just <unk> from lack of sleep .
Well , you can .
You always could .
For a celebrated <unk> , that is an awful <unk> .
Besides , I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Being alone with you has always done this to me .
You know that .
Me ?
Am I ?
Why , I - I don 't know any reason why I should be , unless of course it 's you .
.
.
What is the matter with you ?
You 're <unk> ?
Why , I needed a This won 't do .
Not during business hours .
.
.
I guess I have said enough I 'm just <unk> my breath talking to you .
That will be just about enough !
Now get out of here !
This is my business .
Mr. Dickson 's been like a father to me .
What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this ?
Phyllis , you don 't have to explain anything .
You 'd do well to mind your own business .
No ?
Then maybe you 'll understand , Mrs. Dickson .
Oh , <unk> , he 's crazy about you .
Nobody knows it better than you .
If he ever finds out , it 'll kill him .
I tell you , I 'm not interested in your opinion .
You 've no right to do this to her , Mr. Cluett .
Why don 't you think it over ?
It 's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble .
I 'm not interested in what you think .
Oh no , Mr. Cluett , if it 's all the same to you , I 'd rather not wait .
It 's about you and Mrs. Dickson .
Anything you have to say to me , you can say in the morning .
It 's funny - now that I 'm here , I don 't know just how to go about it .
You see , I kind of expected to find you here alone .
I 'm listening .
Well , I thought I 'd like to have a little talk with you .
Oh , yeah ?
The <unk> said I could stay .
I told him it was important .
Yes , now .
Now ?
Let me see your cash book , will you ?
Yes , sir .
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?
Well , that 's too bad .
Mine 's all right too .
Good morning , Mr. Dickson .
My wife is much better this morning .
Of course , let them in !
You 're late now .
Shall we let the people come in ?
Thank you !
That makes it <unk> .
I feel all right too .
I 'm feeling fine this morning .
Wait a minute .
How do you feel this morning ?
Excuse me Got a <unk> ?

John , how 's your wife this morning ?
Good morning , Mr. Dickson .
In Cluett 's apartment ?
Well dear , you see , I .

Listen , dear .
Now tell me the truth about this .
Were you in Cluett 's apartment ?
Last night ?
Er - why - uh , last night .
.
.
Listen , dear .
I want to ask you something .
I know it 's a silly thing for me to ask you , but .
.
.
I want you to tell me the truth .
Where were you last night ?
No .
Happy now ?
All right .
I 'll <unk> the whole thing until tomorrow night .
Tomorrow night ?
Don 't you forget that I 'm still the head man around here too .
Now we 'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night .
You and I are going out together .
How 's that ?
Well .
.
.
Listen , don 't go around being attractive to anyone but me .
.
.
Ho , ho , ho , yourself !
I wouldn 't laugh if I were you .
You may not suspect it , but I 'm still attractive - to some .
Ho !
Ho !
Ho !
The girls !
I don 't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man .
.
.
You can take some of the girls .
You can take <unk> - or <unk> Yes , of course .
That 's what it was you planned , wasn 't it ?
The theatre ?
Listen , it isn 't so terribly important .
We can go to the theatre any time .
I don 't care whether it 's important or not .
You said you were going out with me , and if you hadn 't promised so faithfully , I wouldn 't have gone and planned the whole thing .
But I have to go , dear .
It 's a very important <unk> 's meeting .
Now Tom , you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight .
That 's all there is to it .
I 'm terribly sorry .
I 'd forgotten all about you .
I 'm so sorry , dear .
Yes .
Oh , I did have a date with you tonight , didn 't I ?
Nothing .
Tom , I thought you were going out with me tonight .
What 's the matter dear ?
What have I done now ?
Oooh !
That has the <unk> !
It 's amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .
If this isn 't a <unk> day for Tom Dickson !
First I <unk> on the Board of Directors , then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier , and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife .
What a man , what a man !
Hello , darling .
Well , look who 's here !
Hello , dear .
Oh , no !
It 's not for you .
You 're only going to get married .
Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon .
Oh !
Say , I know what 's the matter with you .
Matt !
Good morning .
Good morning , Helen .

No , never mind .
You want the rest of those numbers , Mr. Dickson ?
Yes , sir .
Come on in here , Helen .
Bring your book .
I want some numbers to try to get some action .
Get Parker at the <unk> - the <unk> .

Snap into it , Helen .
Just as quick as you can .
Now don 't you worry about it .
In Mr. Sampson 's office .
Where is he now ?
Oh , Mr. Dickson - they 're going to arrest Matt .
They think he did it !
Yes , sir .
Helen , tell Matt I want to see him .
I haven 't got any new stories for them this morning , either .
<unk> .
Directors , eh ?
Long faces ?
Why , the directors are waiting for you in the board room .
Ummm .
<unk> , eh ?
Anything new ?
Why - well , I Guess we 'll just have to sacrifice the bank .
When are you and Matt going to get married ?
I don 't know .
Helen , you 're becoming more beautiful every day .
What are we going to do about it ?
Good morning .
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone .
Yes ?
Helen !
All right .
Send him in .
Mr. Sampson .
.
.
Yes ?
Yes , sir .
Helen , I 'm going to Philadelphia , just as soon as the bank closes .
Make all the arrangements , will you ?
Yes ?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you .
He 'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty .
.
.
But , Mr. Dickson , I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage .
I only want ten thousand .
The property is worth sixty .
Ah , Mrs. Pembroke .
I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the <unk> .
He 's going to take care of that mortgage for you .
.
.
Mr. Dickson ?
Hello , Helen .
Yes , thank you .
Got my <unk> ?
Good morning , Mr. Dickson .
Good morning , Mrs. Pembroke .
I don 't know .
Mr. Sampson bought it for me .
Looks good .
How much did it cost ?
Yes , sir .
Well , well , well - got your uniform , eh ?
Yes , sir .
Oh , make that uniform blue .
You see Sampson .
Tell him I sent you .
You 've got to have a uniform .
Why , I don 't know .
My goodness , you ought to have a uniform .
How much does one cost ?
No , sir .
You haven 't got a uniform ?
I haven 't any .
Wait a minute .
Where 's your uniform ?
Gee , thanks , Mr. Dickson Helen , while you 're downtown , you might stop in and make reservations for the <unk> suite on the <unk> sailing next week .
I don 't want to hear any more about it .
If you don 't get married , I 'll fire both of you .
But I haven 't .
.
.
I want you both to take the day off .
Go downtown and get a license and get married right away !
All right .
That 's all .
Please , Matt .
Aw , I don 't know what you 're talking about .
All I know is that you 're losing your bank and She was , wasn 't she ?
How long has this been going on ?
Do you know ?
Well .
.
.
uh .
.
.
I .
.
.
Wait a minute .
Answer my question .
Was Mrs. Dickson there ?
Listen , Mr. Dickson , don 't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down .
You 've got more friends than anybody in this town .
Little guys - guys who wouldn 't be in business if it weren 't for you .
All you 've got to do is Was Mrs. Dickson there ?
Oh , I can explain about that later .
You 're losing your bank - don 't you realize what that means ?
Were you in Cluett 's apartment ?
You 're not giving up , are you , Mr. Dickson ?
Why wouldn 't you tell me where you were last night ?
We haven 't got much time left , Mr. Dickson .
We 've got to do something quick or it 'll be too late .
Yes , you are .
You 're protecting somebody .
Now listen , it doesn 't make any difference who it is .
It can 't be as important as this .
Now come on , tell me .
Where were you last night ?
Come on , don 't be a fool .
Matt , you trust me , don 't you ?
No , I 'm not Mr. Dickson !
You 're protecting somebody .
No .
I won 't .
I can 't tell you .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Matt , do you realize you 're up against something ?
You 're being charged with murder .
It 's serious , son .
Now come on , I know you didn 't do it .
But we 've got to make them believe it .
Come on , tell the truth , where were you last night ?
There you are .
I already told him I was home .
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too , eh ?
Well , I Aw , go on , forget it .
You came through , didn 't you ?
That 's all I wanted .
A lot of them didn 't think you would .
You don 't know how much <unk> it 's been to me .
It 's been swell .
Well , when are you and Helen going to get married ?
Aw , I 'm sorry , Mr. Dickson .
It 's just kind of sudden , that 's all .
Sure , I 'm excited .
I think it 's great .
Only , well , you 've done so much for me already .
.
.
I 'll never be able to thank you enough .
Say , come on .
Show a little enthusiasm .
What 's the matter ?
Are you sick or something ?
Go on , fake it - even if it isn 't real .
Sure , I think it 's swell .
What 's the matter ?
You don 't seem very excited about it .
And what 's more , keep up the good work and who knows - some day you 'll be the fellow sitting behind that <unk> .
.
.
Not a bad thought , eh ?
It 's all right .
Thanks .
You don 't want to check up on anybody .
I 'll do all the checking up .
Wait a minute .
Don 't worry , Mr. Dickson .
We 'll find out whether he 's telling the truth .
I 'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away .
You 're lying !
No wonder he didn 't want to mention her name .
My wife ?
What 's she got to do with you ?
He 's just confessed .
He 's been mixed up with the toughest <unk> in town .
Why , you must be crazy .
I 've known this man for years .
You were right , Mr. Dickson !
Brown didn 't have anything to do with it .
Here 's your man .
Listen , Matt .
If you don 't tell the truth , I can 't help you .
Where were you last night ?
Of course it 's true - and he knows it .
So have you .
So have I.
So 's everybody got a record .
What difference does that make ?
You can 't go around <unk> crimes on people just because they Maybe .
But I 'm taking no chances .
Why , this kid 's got a record .
What are you talking about ?
He had no more to do with it than you did .
All I know is the bank 's been robbed and a murder 's been committed .
The way I see it , Brown here looks guilty .
Good .
You 've got nothing to worry about .
Soon as the report comes in , you 'll be <unk> .
And listen , don 't talk so loud .
Take it easy .
Coast a little .
That 's what he says .
I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now .
Why , certainly he can .
Matt , now all you 've got to do is tell them where you were last night , between twelve and twelve-thirty , and everything will be all right .
If he can do it , yes .
All right .
If the boy proves an alibi , he 's all right , isn 't he ?
The clock opposite the <unk> was stopped by a bullet at <unk> : <unk> .
What time did this thing happen ?
Yes .
It 's an inside job .
That 's a <unk> .
Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the <unk> .
Now Brown , here , is in charge of the vaults , isn 't he ?
Why pick on him ?
I 'm afraid I must , Mr. Dickson .
What 's the matter ?
What 's going on here ?
This is ridiculous !
You can 't hold this boy on a vague suspicion .
I hate to do this , but I 've got to have time to dig up some help .
I think I know where I can get some real cash .
Snap into it , Sampson .
We will lick this thing yet .
Yes , sir .
Get all the big bills in the place .
Take them out and get them changed .
Get nothing but ones and <unk> .
<unk> them among the <unk> .
Tell them to take their time .
Stall as much as possible .
Count and <unk> the money .
Mr. Dickson !
Mr. Dickson !
Don 't you think I know it ?
We can 't keep open till four o 'clock .
We haven 't cash enough to last an hour .
I 'll talk to them .
Listen , go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible .
Tell ' em not to pay any attention to what I said .
Tell ' em to <unk> every <unk> .
What 'll we do ?
The fools !
If they only knew it , they 're making things worse for themselves .
Somebody starts a silly rumor , and they lose their heads .
Yes , sir .
But soon as our money runs out , they 'll mob the place .
Mine too ?
Yes , sir .
Did you get the case for the securities ?
Look at them , Mr. Dickson .
They 're going crazy .
Yes , sir .
The bank 's reputation wouldn 't be worth a <unk> after that .
This is just a <unk> , that 's all .
They 've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken .
Listen , get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash .
Wait a minute .
Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too .
Tell the boys anyone caught <unk> with a <unk> will be fired on the spot .
We haven 't much on hand , you know .
If it gets any worse , I hope we don 't have to close the doors .
All right .
Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away .
They 've been coming in <unk> all morning .
I have called for some extra police .
What are you talking about ?
The lobby 's half filled now .
Yes , sir .
How about his nights ?
He 's too busy running around .
Tell him to keep tomorrow night open , come in and sign this thing , or I 'll call this whole deal off .
He says he can 't get away in the daytime .
That 's just exactly what he has been doing .
This deal should have been closed weeks ago .
Tell him to keep tomorrow open .
.
.
I 'm afraid he 's been <unk> .
Good .
I 'll take this along with me .
Tell Clyde I 'll see him tomorrow .
I 'm sick and tired of the delay .
Here 's the data on the Clyde deal .
Well , Sampson , what is it ?
Please , lady .
Please be quiet .
Everything will be all right .
Open up here , folks .
All right , folks , please !
But you said it would be safe !
It 's his life insurance money .
Oh , please , I 'll go to the Old <unk> ' Home if you don 't do something , please !
Quiet down , please !
Take it easy , folks .
Everything will be all right .
It 's his life insurance money , you know .
Absolutely .
Is it safe ?
Yes , ma 'am , you can deposit your money here .
All right .
Oh , well .
I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few <unk> of <unk> .
When he comes out , you tell him I 'll be back .
He hasn 't gotten rid of me !
Hardly .
Well , take my word for it , and don 't try it .
It 's <unk> !
If it were some other woman , I could handle her , but after all , you can 't scratch a bank 's eyes out now , can you ?
No .
Helen , did you ever try <unk> with a bank ?
I 'm afraid so .
Board meeting .
Oh , that means hours , I suppose .
He 's at a board meeting .
Is that busy husband of mine busy ?
<unk> , Mrs. Dickson .
Matt , look !
There 's Mr. Jones !
The big guys have got the screws on him .
You 've got to come through for him , Mr. <unk> .
He came through for you a hundred times .
If his friends don 't help him , who is going to help him ?
Mr. <unk> .
.
.
Dickson 's in a jam I tell you .
The run 's getting worse .
Yeah .
I got an idea .
Come on , let 's get to a telephone .
Did you talk to him ?
Sure , they 'd turn him down .
He ought to know that .
I 'm going in there and talk to him .
Yes .
He called some of the biggest people in town .
They must have turned him down .
Something 's happened .
He isn 't trying anymore .
What 's he doing , honey ?
Is he getting any help ?
Don 't cry , honey .
Everything 's gonna be all right .
Oh , Matt .
.
.
All right , dear .
<unk> .
.
.

I 'll wait for you upstairs .
Okay , honey - but just the same I 'd like to take a crack at that Now you 've got me worried , dear .
Promise me you won 't <unk> in .
Can you imagine that guy ?
He was kissing her .
Oh now , don 't be silly .
Who ?
Cluett ?
No , not yet .
But I 'd like to take a crack at that <unk> <unk> , horse dollar .
[ 6 ] Say Matt , you haven 't done anything about what you saw today , have you ?
Oh , Charlie again .
What 's keeping you ?
Yes , right in his office , the <unk> .
I 'd like to take a crack at that guy .
In Cluett 's office ?
I tell you , I saw them !
Oh Matt , you must be mistaken .
Well , he was making love to her .
Well .
.
.

Come here .
You know , a few minutes ago I was in Cluett 's office and Mrs. Dickson was there .
What 's the matter , Matt ?
Gee , I thought you 'd be thrilled to death .
Yeah .
What happened ?
What did he say ?
Did you get the job ?
Yeah , swell .
Say , I just heard the merger isn 't going <unk> .
Isn 't that <unk> ?
Oh , Matt .
All right , I 'm lying .
Don 't forget you called me a liar .
Yes .
Oh , you think I 'm lying ?
No .
A friend of mine - yeah , really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying , would you believe it ?
Yes .
Oh , ten dollars The ten dollars .
With what ?
What did you do with it ?
Oh , is that so ?
Hey , look out , somebody 's likely to see us !
Come here , honey !
Why ?
Matt , come here !
Hello , Helen !
Yes , sir .
Are you sure ?
He came to see Mr. Cluett .
He was here ?
He was in the bank yesterday .
Yes , why ?
Did you say Dude Finlay ?
Yes , sir .
Dude Finlay ?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay 's joint .
Never mind all that .
What did you find out ?
I 've been <unk> the cashier like you told me .
You 're right about that guy , <unk> .
There 's something <unk> somewhere .
What did you find out , <unk> ?
That 's all , Mrs. Halligan .
Thanks .
Listen here , young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it There you are !
No - because me clock struck four , and when it strikes four , it 's one .
Yes , I know .
Cause the Dooley sisters weren 't in yet .
No .
It wasn 't earlier because ...
It couldn 't have been earlier ?
Yes , I guess it was one , ' cause ... Was it twelve o 'clock ?
That 's just what I 'm trying to tell you , sir .
It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters .
.
.
I don 't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in ?
Now , let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after What time did Matt Brown get in ?
Huh ?
What time was it ?
It was late , I know .
The Dooley sisters was already in .
They work at a show , you know .
What time was it , Mrs. Halligan ?
for the <unk> , you know .
Sure I do .
He has the best room in me house .
The one with the fancy <unk> .
Do you know this young man , Mrs. Halligan ?
Then where were you ?
But I wasn 't here , Mr. Dickson .
Honest I wasn 't .
.
.
Yes .
<unk> o 'clock , eh ?
Are you sure it was that ?
Well , about - uh - <unk> o 'clock .
What time did you get in ?
Yes .
So you were home last night ?
I don 't know .
Then who changed it ?
You used to carry a gun , didn 't you ?
I didn 't do it !
I haven 't got a gun !
Sit down !
When the watchman surprised you , you shot him - what 'd you do with the gun ?
wasn 't anywhere near this place You turned off the <unk> alarm , you set the time clock , came back at twelve and <unk> the boxes , didn 't you ?
They 're starting to come in already .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Well , listen .
Don 't waste any time .
Get all the money you can lay your hands on , and bring it down here right away .
Step on it .
Certainly , Mr. Jones !
Certainly !
Charlie !
Charlie 's upstairs as <unk> as a pup .
He 's out fourteen cents , and he can 't find it .
Where 's Charlie ?
I guess so .
Everybody in ?
<unk> himself a <unk> !
Yeah , what did he do with his first one ?
That mug <unk> me of a guy with his second dollar .
You 've got enough ?
I 'm okay , Matt .
How are you fixed ?
Okay , Matt .
You 're carrying too much money on you , <unk> .
You better turn some in tonight .
Now you tell us .
Sometimes a wound will kill .
This is <unk> ?
Jim Younger , I told you-- I couldn 't lose him .
Tom , I 'm this close to coming with you ...
I think I may just go on to the reservation .
I said like a Comanche , not this Comanche .
You can ride like that ?
It 's <unk> than it looks .
He 's not bad at it .
Things changed when you quit the gang .
For example , I 'm now the one who says " Let 's ride . "
You 're just upset about Jesse .
We all are .
I 'm sorry , Cole .
Swear on Jimmy 's grave .
I swear -- Swear .
Bob .
I didn 't ... WHAT <unk> YOU <unk> ? !
I ain 't done -- What have you done ?
How 'd they -- Leave me alone , Bob .
Cole , we 're outlaws .
Not exactly the most respectable job , if you know what I mean .
As long as people think Jesse 's still riding , we will never get the respect we deserve .
That was because of ... the reputation the gang had .
It 's still taking too long .
The people used to snap to .
This is the best score yet .
What ?
That 's what the newspapers say .
<unk> 't for Jesse James , this gang wouldn 't be able to find a <unk> 's ass with a stick .
Frankly , yes .
I 'm feeling a little left out .
We got a problem here , brother ?
Say we bust into a bank .
We <unk> " We 're the Younger-James Gang ! "
People are gonna be thinking , " The <unk> James Gang ?
Is there an older James Gang ?
How come we never heard of the older James gang ? "
So people are trying to figure that out instead of <unk> their arms .
How ?
No , Jimmy has a point .
The Younger-James Gang could be confusing .
You stay out of this , Bob .
Uhh , yeah it does .
Better pass them over here before something happens to ' em .
These are <unk> and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad .
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men .
The <unk> says it was a gang of drunk <unk> boys .
Our place , Clell Miller 's , Sammy <unk> , the <unk> .
Will <unk> .
Zee , I 'm pleased you came .
Here 's Liberty 's favorite son !
I 'll never forget what you did , cousin .
That was two hours ago .
Your Ma wouldn 't let us leave until we ate something .
Anywhere nobody 's shooting at me is pretty .
Never thought that <unk> town would look so pretty .
Never a good thing .
He 's smiling .
Dammit , this stopped being fun about two years ago !
Gatling !
They 've got a Gatling !
Tomorrow .
The Army can hang him .
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the <unk> -- Damn !
He just lost his temper a little .
Oh no ...
They came up , made the same offer they made you folks .
Our little brother Jim tried to <unk> ' em off , one of those detectives hit him in the head , knocked him out .
Cole lost his temper .
Stop by our spread after that , tell our Ma we 're all right .
We 'll go to Doc Mimms .
Cole , I want to get to the farm , make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay .
... Will <unk> ... Jesus mercy , that 's Charlie <unk> , Dave <unk> ... Then I love it .
Nope .
<unk> gonna shoot at me ?
Well , somebody better go tell THE DAMN <unk> !
Yesterday .
I can hit those boys from here .
We just need a distraction .
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working <unk> fine , thank you .
Tell me .
Listen , he 's my brother and I don 't want to start trouble ... What ?
He 's planning a job .
He 's been full of <unk> lately .
Listen , Jesse , we 've got a problem .
It 's Cole .
You are a fine figure of a man .
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here ...
Yes .
I am obviously not standing out in people 's minds at the robberies .
This is about the " Wanted ! "
<unk> , isn 't it .
You heard me , Jesse .
You know how crazy I get !
<unk> pardon ?
One false move and I 'll blow your heads off !
Okay , folks , I think we know how this is going to go ... " Bank <unk> <unk> the loss at fifty thousand dollars . "
Hey !
" The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town , <unk> the <unk> and three other <unk> . "
We oughta take some of this , give it to our <unk> in Liberty .
Lot of people hurting up there .
Well , no , Jesse , it was the bank 's .
That 's why we had to go to all that trouble of <unk> it .
You explain it to him .
All right , settle down .
All this money ain 't ours .
Exactly .
But if we take their money and <unk> ... Not yet .
But I 'm hoping .
You have no shame .
Two .
How many of them did he kill ?
Best damn plan I heard all war .
Home .
We go home .
We ride like hell to get there , and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes .
And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again .
No , really .
You 're wife said she needed some help , seeing as you were so fat you couldn 't find your -- You shut up now , boy .
I think I saw you leavin ' by the front door just as I was coming in the back .
How ?
I think I recognize you .
What you <unk> ' boy ?
You , ya <unk> of pork <unk> .
Here piggy piggy !
What ?
We didn 't .
Zerelda did .
<unk> out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw .
Where 'd you get all these <unk> ?
Pff .
All we been through , the thought never crossed my mind .
You know , you gettin ' caught , right after leaving us , some people thought -- Missed you too , cousin .
Missed you , cousin .
Who 's next ?
You ?
Me ?
Bob ?
WHAT ? !
We follow you for a year , and now that our blood 's been <unk> , you 're gonna quit ? !
I 'm out .
We 'll make them pay for this .
Pass me some whisky .
Bob , rip up some <unk> .
Clell , Tom , go get Doc Mimms in Liberty !
Okay , you 're gonna rest here .
A trap .
Dammit !
You 'll be smiling once you 've got all that money to spend , cousin .
Cole Younger 's going to make everybody rich !
Fine .
We hit this bank .
Then let me run the show , General Lee .
Still <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm the better outlaw .
I 'm the better <unk> , Jesse .
That 's it .
And almost got hanged in <unk> .
I got us through the War all right .
A bad idea .
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- <unk> .
You 're forgetting who 's in charge -- I 've robbed just as many banks as you have !
I know this town , and I know this bank , and I say it 's an easy job .
What are you saying ?
If you 'd read about it first , you 'd have no problems .
Smells funny , it being mentioned in the paper .
What will be ?
It 'll be the biggest score yet .
Hold on , hold on , we all know Bob is an important part of the gang .
This is your fault for <unk> all the <unk> .
Why aren 't we the " Younger-James Gang " ?
I mean , there 's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here .
Yep .
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the " James-Younger Gang . "
Sure , cousin .
Jesse , we got to have a word .
Twenty ? !
" The <unk> Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men . "
It 's better .
It 's a construction depot .
They 'll have the <unk> and some ammo and <unk> for us to take .
That way we can take on a bigger job .
It 's not a bank .
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn 't make him smart .
See , Frank 's being smart about this .
I got three .
I got seven thousand .
Don 't let it happen again .
Sorry .
The James-Younger Gang .
Let 's ride .
Perfect , Cole .
I 'll pick the first job !
I mean ...
I know a girl down at the bank .
See if she can 't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money .
Just like in the war .
<unk> their <unk> lines .
We kill the railroad 's men , they won 't care .
So what do we do , General Lee ?
This isn 't a <unk> , this is war .
They 've got more men than we do .
We kill detectives , they can replace ' em in a day .
Yeah .
Because we were good at it ?
Hell , we were great at it .
Jesse , don 't tell anyone I said this , because everybody knows I 'm the toughest man in this town , but you are one <unk> sonofabitch with those guns .
But it was a whole lot of killing .
Why should we miss that ?
It was exciting .
The war ?
What , are you crazy ?
There are things I miss about it .
After all you did on our farm ?
You miss it , don 't you Jesse ?
Thanks for the help .
All right , calm down .
I 'll agree Sadie was a woman -- She was European !
She had a moustache .
She got two of them .
You ever notice Zerelda 's eyes ?
In case we have to kill these <unk> , I don 't want them to see us coming .
What is wrong with you ?
Not now .
Pick your fights , cousin .
You taught me that .
You 're not scared , are you ?
Hands off your hip , Cole .
<unk> corn .
<unk> corn .
<unk> after year .
Home , boys .
Back to our farms .
There 's Yankees back there .
Lot 's of ' em .
Where you boys going ?
Suit yourself .
We 'll have some <unk> waiting for you at the road .
Let 's ride , <unk> !
I could use the walk .
<unk> with me , cousin ?
What 's going on ?
<unk> time you got here , buddy .
I 'm thinking ... Well ?
Hmm .
Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt <unk> , or work for you ... Tom , why don 't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation ?
Figure we might have some work for you , if you want .
You ride like a Comanche .
Wait 'll we get back to Missouri , start telling those <unk> about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself !
You pay me to find you <unk> .
There they are .
Some Indian <unk> you turned out to be , Tom .
They 're just insurance in case we run .
They gonna rush us ?
Another dozen out back .
Cole , he didn 't mean that .
Oh , you 're in charge ?
We ain 't partners any more , Jesse ?
You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride ?
Jesse .
-- Exactly .
Because this is a war .
<unk> .
Hey !
We decide something , that 's it !
We 're in this for the long <unk> , and this idea of me and Jesse 's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some <unk> with a shotgun <unk> ' up on us in our sleep .
We 've got to think -- Get <unk> !
<unk> !
Come back here and face me !
Ah .
Shakespeare .
He 's European .
I have no idea what you just said , but it sounded real nice .
Sadie was not a man !
Oh , Lord , the dance hall girl at <unk> 's ...
The brown one .
Which one , right or left ?
I think one of ' em 's glass .
Must be a garrison in town .
We 're in occupied <unk> , boys .
What the -- Soon as I hit one , the other 'll know and beat us up .
Both would be nice .
<unk> or Gatling ?
All right , all right .
Jesse James never <unk> at folk ... OPEN THE DAMN <unk> !
This here is the Younger Gang !
Where is Jesse James ?
What ?
Of course !
Uh , sir ?
The safe .
Now .
Me get <unk> <unk> -- Go ahead to the saloon .
But don 't get too drunk !
Ho-yah !
East ?
East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass ?
Ho-yah .
Him say tell Big <unk> in <unk> that <unk> Jesse James riding toward <unk> Sun , above Great River , near Eagle Rock .
Of St. Louis ?
The District Marshall Great Chief of St. Louis send me .
Yeah , Injun .
What do you want ?
You ' um big <unk> ?
I 'd appreciate that .
Fine .
I 'll just wait here .
It 's a secret .
Oh .
Why didn 't you just say so ?
On account of we 're robbing it .
Then why can 't I go in there ?
You 're right , sir .
I know it ain 't no <unk> bank holiday !
Shit .
I had you covered .
From back there .
Where the hell were you ?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody ?
So ?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank .
What is it ?
What the -- It 's fine by me , Jesse .
<unk> , but I was thinking , I could come by , and then take Zee out .
Some place near .
With other folk .
<unk> .
Here .
But out .
You know you 're welcome any time !
Go on .
You 're pretty much all <unk> up .
What do you say , sir ?
Go home , Doc .
They ain 't gonna hang no more Liberty boys .
Boys ... Died a hero .
Web died fighting ?
Pff .
He <unk> his horse clear over our heads , killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them .
My little Web did that ?
-- <unk> right into them , screaming like a <unk> .
I 'm upset too , Zee , but Jesse and Cole know what they 're doing .
I 'm sure they won 't press their luck .
He thinks this is some kind of game !
I think he 's already feeling better .
Well , I hope the boy pulls through .
We should know in the morning .
I fooled them into thinking I was alone .
They 're gone .
What are you -- The bullet came out clean , but he lost a whole lot of blood .
<unk> wouldn 't hurt .
He 's going to be fine , right Daddy ?
Zerelda , it 's no coincidence .
The railroad men come through , offering to buy up land .
Nobody <unk> .
Then they start hanging men who own farms for <unk> ?
Daddy , don 't start with this again .
Hell , they hardly even noticed us .
See you soon .
Oh , and I appreciate the distraction back there .
I 'll meet you down there in a few weeks .
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .
A war against the railroad .
What the hell were we thinking ?
Yeah .
You 're a <unk> liar for the <unk> man I know .
Railroad burned him out too .
You couldn 't have stopped him .
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West .
How was he supposed to say no to that ?
Jim was old enough ... <unk> learned with Web .
Made it look fun , made it look like an adventure .
Got Web killed .
Now Jim .
Got any ideas , little brother ?
They 're all pinned down .
Can 't even get to the door .
No , I -- You taking sides against me , now , Frank ?
Just do me a favor .
Think about what this is <unk> everybody .
Not just the railroad .
Oh yeah .
We 're drunk .
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee ?
What do you want me to say , Frank ?
I was killing men when I was fifteen .
I like getting shot at .
I like riding out of town with a <unk> at my back .
This is a helluva better life than farming .
Maybe it started out that way .
But now ... We 're doing this for Ma .
I can 't quit and leave you alone .
I can 't quit until you quit .
Ma would 've wanted it that way .
That 's a lie .
You could 've bought a dozen farms with the money we 've stolen .
If I could go back to farming -- You 've killed your fair share of men .
It got to you , didn 't it .
All the killing in the war .
You need it now .
And we 're good at it .
Jesse , we 're outlaws .
This has been a good year .
Bob here 'll kill a man for <unk> , and he 's the best shot in the gang .
Pardon the delay , folks , but we had to get <unk> Bob Younger under control !
The posters ?
Bob 's upset .
<unk> , we are in the middle of something here .
It 's the <unk> <unk> .
It 's all the <unk> .
I don 't think it 's <unk> .
Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to <unk> ?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives .
And it 's guarded by Pinkerton detectives .
And that 's why you both lead the gang .
Two of you went into that bank together , right ?
And I planned getting you off the <unk> 's deck -- We 're gonna have to talk ... Fine .
How 'd it go out here ?
How 'd it go in there ?
Make a thousand of ' em .
Still won 't be enough by the time I 'm through .
Didn 't think you would .
I 'm going to go make the coffin .
Don 't care .
... We could move on .
<unk> .
Make a decent life someplace else .
Ma .
Pinkertons .
It 's the railroad .
Shut up .
Uh , Doc , I was wondering if , uh , this evening , I could come by ?
You 're looking a bit more <unk> now that somebody -- Would you get in the <unk> ?
Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself , she 's gonna make me <unk> .
What do you think ?
You ready to stop <unk> around with this young lady and get back to farming ?
Damn .
All that reading paid off .
I went up to the <unk> and looked at the right of way documents for the <unk> bed .
The railroad doesn 't even need our land , they 're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can .
Heard of him .
You know him ?
Your Zee ?
Hmm .
" From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive : they sparkle still the right <unk> fire ; They are the books , the <unk> , the <unk> , that show , contain , and <unk> all the world . "
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee .
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back .
She 's still talking to Jesus .
Next time try " fat and <unk> . "
I swear I 'll shoot you in your sleep .
You are a <unk> .
You can shut up now .
" Big and older " ?
Maybe , maybe ... That just might work .
What kind of story are they going to believe ?
Think about this .
If we just come up with a story and stick to it , we should be all right .
All we thought about was coming home .
I swore I 'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again .
If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay , fine by me .
Saved all our lives , Doc .
None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms , Doc .
God 's honest truth .
<unk> ... he took down the Gatling gun and the <unk> all by himself .
Zee , we got to talk to you and your father .
You 're doing just fine .
Frank , don 't you have something to say ?
We better go to Doc 's , see what 's going on here .
Looks like Web Mimms wasn 't the only <unk> this town 's got .
All this time in the saddle ... We get to the farm , I 'm going to shoot this damn horse just on <unk> .
Hello , Liberty <unk> !
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .
Hell of a war .
I <unk> .
Web 's dead .
No , Jesse , your problem is you 're always doing stuff before I 'm finished figuring it out .
See , that 's your problem , Frank .
By the time you finish figuring out stuff , I 'm already finished doing it .
I figure .
That would have made an impression .
You could have worn one of those big , <unk> woman 's <unk> Sunday <unk> .
Such as ?
<unk> .
So you 're saying I could have done more to <unk> their attention .
Pff .
They hardly even noticed you .
<unk> enough for you ?
So we got a plan ?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling , they try to shoot it off .
Everything but the boring parts .
How much of that story is true ?
Yeah Jimmy ?
Uncle Frank ?
I think ... he was just a real <unk> ' fella to have around .
So what was he ?
Can 't argue that .
But he killed a lot of men , too .
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad .
They 're making him a hero now .
That he was .
Sounds like he was a hell of a man .
<unk> a man his version of the past .
When you get to be my age , you 've got enough painful memories , you 're allowed to <unk> a few of the <unk> up .
I know .
But that 's how it should have ended .
Your Dad and Mom , riding off into a new life , growing old together , happy .
... every time you tell that story , you stop there .
That 's not how it ended .
I was five when my dad got shot .
Yeah , Jimmy ?
<unk> 'know , Uncle Frank ... <unk> .
Doc Mimms will -- Take care of each other , boys .
You say your prayers .
We know , Ma .
Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms .
<unk> -- Boys ?
Ma !
Please !
Somebody 's in a <unk> <unk> mood today .
The Lord says we can bury ' em out back in the <unk> , nobody 'll ever find them .
We 're just fine , thank you , sir .
<unk> .
He 's a good Christian and he killed Yankees .
Jesus told me that made him an all right boy .
Ma , I 'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend .
Say your prayers ?
A fair number , Ma .
Did you kill Yankees ?
I 'll explain on the way .
Tennessee ?
Yes ma 'am .
Don 't swear .
You are a hell of a woman .
I can 't believe I had to blow up a train for you .
Yes ma 'am .
You get arrested again , I 'll kill you .
If you don 't see it , it 's not real ... What ?
Don 't turn around .
Swimming .
Swimming is good .
Stop it .
This is just sad .
Aw , <unk> , ma 'am ... Jesse , have you ever noticed that when you 're trying to charm your way out of trouble , your <unk> gets all farm boy ?
Now , sweetie , y <unk> wouldn 't go believing one of them silly dime <unk> , would you ?
Oh , I 'm not finished .
" When he <unk> into a saloon , his <unk> <unk> and his pockets full of gold , the ladies <unk> around him like flies to a <unk> <unk> . "
As I said .
Hmm .
Let me see that .
" <unk> <unk> of the West .
True <unk> of Jesse James . "
Only a dime in the hotel lobby .
I beg your pardon ?
" But the life of the James Gang wasn 't all robbing and shooting and killing , for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies ... especially the <unk> and charismatic Jesse James . "
" Hmm " what ?
Hmm .
Now wait a minute .
There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding .
I 've got you .
You keep me busy .
I figure we 'll get over to the hotel ... get checked in , cleaned up ... then I 'd like to do something I 've been thinking about for a long time .
Are you going to be happy here , Mr. James ?
Without all that <unk> ?
That 's why I picked it .
We can start a whole new life down here .
I would never have <unk> us in a place like this .
She 's beautiful .
Smart .
And has the biggest ... buck teeth in all of Missouri .
That 's ... wonderful .
It 's just ...
I thought ... She 's the most wonderful woman in the world .
Can 't get her out of my mind .
I don 't understand .
I had to see you .
I 'm getting married .
Jesse .
What are you thinking ?
There are <unk> <unk> and lawmen all over this county !
Zee .
When my name makes them cry in their sleep .
When I 've brought them to <unk> .
Whose justice ?
<unk> or God 's ?
When will you stop ?
<unk> don 't touch men like Thaddeus Rains .
Only justice does .
Let the law -- Me neither .
You and I , we 've started ... something , you know ?
I don 't know what 'll happen if you do this .
Frank and me have to go away for a while .
I am so sorry , Jesse .
I 've been planning on <unk> ' you for a very long time .
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished <unk> ?
Yep .
Is this one of Frank 's Shakespeare <unk> you 're trying to quote ?
Little ones .
<unk> rocks ?
Ahem .
" From this doctrine ... " No , ah ... " From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive , they sparkle still like ... <unk> ... <unk> rocks ... " <unk> , you 'd do if only you had the buck teeth .
Where will you find such a girl ?
Smart .
Funny .
<unk> .
Always makes me think she 's two steps ahead of me .
And big buck teeth .
And what 's this right girl like ?
Not if I find the right girl .
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life , Jesse James ?
Mostly .
It would be an all right life , for a bachelor .
Thank God you <unk> out of that .
You did grow out of that , didn 't you ?
<unk> .
<unk> over your <unk> , <unk> .
A river pirate .
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .
You didn 't want to farm ?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older .
<unk> .
You are completely unfair .
So you 're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger ?
I wasn 't the only one risking my neck that day .
Everybody in the county knows it was you who <unk> Cole .
We 're all so proud of you , Jesse .
And not a single farm 's been sold to the railroad since .
You 're everybody 's hero .
What ?
I shouldn 't <unk> a hero .
What you do to me is unfair .
The teasing , I mean .
<unk> you is completely unfair .
No !
I mean , of course not .
No .
You 're sick of my company ?
I 've been on my back two weeks .
I 'm sick of it .
You shouldn 't be up .
<unk> ... Jesse , is that your hand ?
Mmmm .
Jesse , are you awake ?
If there 's anything we can do for you , Dr. Mimms .
We want to help .
But still died .
But you got big !
You were little Jesse James when you left .
Zerelda ?
Little Zee Mimms ?
<unk> enough .
I 'd just as soon kill you , Jesse James .
But chasing you takes up too much of my time .
Thanks .
The railroad has no business in Tennessee .
Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee .
He 's too important , James .
They 'll set the <unk> on you .
You and your wife .
That was for my Ma .
Now this is for everybody else .
No , I 'll hang you .
But I may miss you just a bit .
<unk> , you 'll miss me .
You <unk> little bastard .
I 'm not hanged yet .
That 's what I would have done .
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it .
Was it worth it ?
I figured .
Oh .
That 's nice to know .
We 're going to hang you , you know .
No , that one was close .
A couple fellas quit after that one .
I went myself to <unk> the operation .
Didn 't help much .
Almost got me in <unk> .
I saw you there , shooting at me .
Damn .
The cows had a <unk> from a farm just five miles out of town .
Yes ?
You had all those cattle there , so I 'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive ?
Mmm .
Last February ?
How did you spot the <unk> in <unk> ?
Pity .
You almost ended my career before it began .
Not that day .
I am guilty of many things , but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker , that day .
Did you order our <unk> burned down ?
That 's the idea .
So I 'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains ?
Oh , it 's a similar room .
But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You 're not going to get a fair trial down here , in front of a jury of Jesse James <unk> .
But I like the <unk> suite .
We 're moving you tomorrow .
<unk> .
Right here in church ?
Now let 's have a drink .
Who needs to <unk> a <unk> church roof .
Thank you .
<unk> ?
Sir , I am a man of the <unk> .
I could have lied I suppose , but I want this marriage to be legal .
I just want you to know , I 'm trying to start a new life here .
I 'm <unk> on your ...
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the <unk> .
" Jesse <unk> James . "
Jesse James ?
The Jesse James ?
You don 't think God 'll mind , do you ?
This is <unk> .
Most of our marriages are members of the <unk> .
You 're gonna tell her when you 're <unk> up in bed with her , Jimmy .
Jesse , you explain to Lyla .
My girl , you know , from that time ...
This time we 'll make an exception .
... too young for whisky ...
It 's his money .
He 's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune .
You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains , don 't you Jesse ?
What about that Rock Island bastard ?
You do that .
Tell you something else .
I can 't drink that good neither .
I 'm going to go outside and throw up .
I swear .
You and Frank and Cole , and even Bob , get all these girls because you 're good looking and famous .
You don 't have to pay .
They just look at me like I 'm the baby brother .
Don 't tell anyone , okay Jesse ?
I think so .
Hell yeah !
I been with ...
Uh , not exactly .
It 's just , I don 't want to get one of these paid ladies , you know ?
You been with a girl ever ?
Well , not exactly .
Tonight ?
Why , I 'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm .
Jim , you been with a girl yet ?
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole .
Now it 's my turn .
I guess so .
Not too young to shoot a man , not to young to drink .
Yeah .
Hey , are you drinking whisky ?
You 're too young to be drinking whisky .
You okay , Jesse ?
No .
I like that .
And the same age Web was .
No .
I 'm the same age you were when you went off to war .
And you 're too young .
Don 't talk about it much , though .
Really ?
Devereux .
My brother Cole dated a European girl once .
That is so <unk> of you .
Why don 't we get a bottle of <unk> to <unk> while we talk ?
Could we go upstairs and talk ?
It 's so loud down here .
Gosh , that 's a pretty name .
Buy you a drink ?
Lyla Devereux .
Thank you , Miss -- ?
I just though you were awful cute .
Not at all .
I hope I 'm not being too forward .
Really ?
Yes , but just so I could find out who you were .
Oh , you were talking to Jesse .
I hope you don 't mind , Jesse James told me your name .
Why , yeah .
Move you fools !
There 's only four of them ...
They <unk> money to farmers , to <unk> .
<unk> has it they gave the <unk> of <unk> so much money they were able to build a school .
How can that be ?
By burning down their homes ?
They had to be dealt with !
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time .
It 's not my job to relax .
I 've put men <unk> out both ways down <unk> Street , so nobody can ride in shooting .
I 've got a <unk> up on the water tower just in case .
Relax , Alan .
The Army has this all in hand .
And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news .
Nothing like a hanging to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
I 'm doing you folks a favor -- Well , this land is about to be <unk> .
Not such a <unk> now , is he , Pinkerton ?
How did you know ?
I remember you .
This is him .
Oh , that .
I 'll let <unk> explain .
That .
What , sir ?
What is that ?
Sir ?
Parker .
I look forward to seeing it .
The final route for the railroad is complete .
We should go burn that school to the ground , sir !
With my money !
What is going on here , man ?
Your men knew the risks .
We did .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ? !
To be <unk> , they didn 't blow up the tracks .
I 'll kill them for <unk> up my <unk> !
Thirty-five thousand , sir .
<unk> and <unk> .
And the delay from the miles of destroyed track -- How much did they get from the safe ?
They <unk> fire with the Pinkerton <unk> , killing several of them .
Then they <unk> the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile .
I 'll teach these <unk> what happens when they <unk> the <unk> of progress .
I see .
I 'll get together four <unk> of our detectives for action tonight .
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool .
I see a power <unk> to be filled .
As we have the most power , we may move with <unk> .
A further <unk> is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty .
We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers .
Just perfect .
Yes sir .
Leaving you in charge of operations until he <unk> .
Unfortunately not , sir .
A gang of local <unk> managed to rescue him from the <unk> .
Not only has this <unk> <unk> from the other farmers , the <unk> Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident .
Good .
Two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers .
Parker , tell me what 's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my <unk> and <unk> , not <unk> in that order .
I can completely understand your <unk> , sir .
NO !
It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this <unk> piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to <unk> a few simple farmers from their <unk> <unk> <unk> so that I may build the <unk> railroad that this country has ever seen !
Really !
And it is my pleasure to be here .
Mr. Thaddeus Rains , sir , it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field .
<unk> .
What the hell is that sound ?
Why , their intense hatred of you , of course .
What is that ?
No need .
I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
Can you put men at all four ?
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
In English , Pinkerton .
Every three months , the James Gang <unk> back to the <unk> of Liberty , Missouri .
They always pull a job right before they return , probably to have extra money to give family and friends .
No .
So he 's won .
It 's going to be a long spring .
Can 't you tell me anything ?
No , you demand results .
They are not the same thing .
And if you want results , you will let me do my job as I see fit .
Unless of course , You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it ?
I demand action .
Yes , that 's the way to win the locals back to our side .
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk <unk> , as heroes .
I can 't believe this .
First of all : you , shut up .
Now , you 've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover .
Every time the James Gang strikes , we shift a hundred detectives to that area .
But there 's just too much open land , too many <unk> to ride , <unk> to hide in .
This gang <unk> across four states , often riding a hundred miles between jobs .
All of the James Gang 's <unk> have been with local law enforcement who , quite frankly , are no match for this group 's <unk> .
Pinkerton .
It 's been eight months .
I see robberies .
I see hold <unk> .
But I do not see men on the end of <unk> .
It 's going to be a long winter .
So you can 't tell me anything ?
Hardly farmers .
I 've done some checking .
All these were in the War .
These men know <unk> , <unk> , and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them .
They are <unk> , <unk> and have a charismatic leader .
If I were to design the perfect outlaw band , this gang is what I would create .
I 'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play <unk> with these farmers !
It 's early in the game yet , Mr.
Rains .
Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves , feeling out each other 's <unk> .
Oh , that 's the best part .
" The gang made off with <unk> thousand dollars and also destroyed the <unk> <unk> construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without <unk> the railroad is coming to steal their land ! "
Who wrote this ! ?
I 'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month !
It is a nice piece of writing .
" A Rock Island and <unk> Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis , Missouri .
The brave and <unk> James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives , but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West . "
I 'm afraid our <unk> don 't agree .
This is no game .
Would a jury around here convict their own ?
I think not .
We 're beginning an interesting game here , Mr.
Rains .
I want them arrested and hanged !
Oh no , I would have done that .
But I would have made sure I killed them , too .
You wouldn 't have done that ?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives .
Look at this , Pinkerton !
They got the payroll , and this damage will set construction back two months at least .
Nothing .
Yes ?
Patrick ?
Yes , Courtney ?
Isn 't that special ?
Patrick ?
You look marvelous .
There 's nothing to say .
You 're going to marry Luis .
Next week , no <unk> .
Listen ... Patrick .
Can we talk ?
You never noticed .
I never knew you smoked .
We were supposed to have dinner at <unk> and <unk> 's , <unk> know how Luis is ... You and ... Luis ?
That 's nice .
Dinner at the River <unk> .
<unk> Bar afterwards , maybe .
What are you doing tonight ?
Maybe .
Will you call me before <unk> ?
Oh God , just get it over with .
See ?
Happy ?
You dumb bitch ?
Are you happy , you dumb bitch ?
Well , it 's not a turn-on for me .
I have a <unk> coming to me .
I don 't want to get AIDS .
Oh Christ , this really isn 't worth it .
And see , Courtney , it 's there for what ?
Huh ?
Tell us .
Why is it pulled down half an inch ?
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate !
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip to catch the force of the ejaculate !
BATEMAN I 'm getting out of here .
Where 's your lithium ?
Why ?
Take it off .
It 's a plain end , see ?
So ?
Patrick .
Turn on the Light .
He turns on the light .
Oh Jesus .
I 'm going home .
Turn the light on .
It 's a plain end .
I think .
What do you want , Courtney ?
Pull out , goddamnit !
I 'm ignoring you .
Pull out .
Is it a what ?
No , you idiot .
I said " Is it a receptacle tip ? "
Not , is Luis a despicable twit .
Is it a receptacle tip ?
Get off me .
Yes , Luis is a despicable twit .
I hate him .
Luis is a despicable twit .
Mmmm ... thanks , Patrick .
Courtney , you 're going to have the <unk> <unk> soup with smoked duck and <unk> <unk> .
New York magazine called it a ' <unk> but <unk> little dish . "
You 'll love it .
And then ... the red <unk> with <unk> and pine nuts .
I think that 'll follow nicely .
Yes , dear .
This is Dorsia ?
Yes .
Are we here ?
<unk> on the rocks .
<unk> I have that with a twist ?
She starts to <unk> back in her chair and Bateman <unk> over and pulls her back up .
J & <unk>
Straight .
I just want to have a child .
Just ... two ... perfect ... children ... You know , Courtney , you should take some more lithium .
Or have a <unk> <unk> .
Some <unk> might get you out of this <unk> .
Oh God , Patrick .
Shut up .
Is that Donald <unk> 's car ?
A facial at Elizabeth <unk> , which was really <unk> , then to the <unk> <unk> where I bought this <unk> muffin dish .
Sounds like I 'll have to .
Don 't fall asleep , okay ?
Wear something fabulous .
Dorsia , remember ?
Pick me up ?
Eight ?
Okay .
Yeah .
What time ?
The question is do you like it , Courtney ?
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight .
You like it there , don 't you ?
Nice ?
Dorsia 's nice .
I 'm thinking Dorsia .
I can 't .
Courtney ?
Dinner ?
Patrick don 't call me pumpkin anymore , okay ?
I have to go .
Pumpkin , you 're dating a tumbling , tumbling dickweed .
I know .
Stop it .
Pumpkin you 're dating the biggest dickweed in New York .
Uh huh .
Pumpkin you 're dating an asshole .
Yes ?
Pumpkin ?
Ummm .
.
yeah .
Luis is calling me tonight .
I need to be home for that .
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight ?
You should come have dinner with me .
<unk> <unk> ?
<unk> for Luis to call me .
He said he 'd call tonight .
Oh don 't be difficult , Patrick .
On a lot of lithium ?
Stop it .
I 'm ...
Listen , you 're dating Luis , he 's in <unk> .
You 're fucking me , and we haven 't made plans .
What could you possibly be up to tonight ?
What ?
Oh , I 'm ... busy .
Listen , what are you doing tonight ?
It 's not that nice .
This is <unk> than your other apartment .
Oh , <unk> are so <unk> 't do that .
Here .
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer .
Really ?
Well , I actually might need a little <unk> after last time .
So , you 're looking great , how have you been ?
Alright .
Nothing like last time , promise .
I don 't think so .
Oh this won 't be anything like last time , I promise .
I 'm not so sure about this .
I had to go to Emergency after last time ... Actually , that 's none of your business , Christie , <unk> I can assure you it certainly wasn 't cheap .
You have a really nice place here ... Paul .
How much did you pay for it ?
Do you take American Express ?
I 'm not supposed to .
But I can make an exception .
Do you want to come to my apartment or not ?
Would you like to see my apartment ?
You just haven 't been looking .
I haven 't seen you around here .
I have to return some videotapes .
But where ?
I 'm just leaving .
Where are you going ?
I 'm leaving now .
I 've <unk> the situation and I 'm going .
Oh God , I can 't believe this .
If you really want to do something for me , you can stop making this scene right now .
I know my behavior is ... erratic sometimes .
No , no , no .
I 'm ... in touch with <unk> .
Evelyn , I 'm sorry .
You 're just not terribly important to me .
You 're <unk> .
We never really shared one .
But what about the past ?
Our past ?
Yes , I am .
You 're really serious , aren 't you ?
I know that your friends are my friends .
I 've thought about that .
You can have them .
But your friends are my friends .
My friends are your friends .
I don 't think it would work .
You have a little something on your upper <unk> .
I 'm fucking serious .
It 's fucking over .
Us .
This is no joke .
I don 't think we should see each other anymore .
<unk> , touchy .
I 'm sorry I brought the wedding up .
Let 's just <unk> the issue , alright ?
Now , are we having coffee ?
It 's over , Evelyn .
It 's all over Talk about what , Patrick ?
What is there to talk about ?
We need to talk .
My need to engage in <unk> behavior on a <unk> scale cannot be , um , corrected , but I have no other way to <unk> my needs .
Why ?
What 's wrong ?
I think , Evelyn , that we 've ... lost touch .
I want a firm <unk> .
It 's not .
Your <unk> looks like it 's <unk> .
No .
I 'm not .
Why should I ?
Are you using <unk> ?
Everybody has a great body now .
He has a great body Everybody 's good-looking , Patrick .

He 's an artist .
Because I ... want ... to ... fit ... in .
Well , you hate that job anyway .
Why don 't you just quit ?
You don 't have to work .
I don 't want to talk about it .
Your father practically owns the company .
You can do anything you like , silly .

No , serial killer , Wisconsin in the fifties .
He was an interesting guy .

Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
Thanks , guy , but ... she 's got a <unk> personality .
<unk> dig Bateman .
He 's CQ .
You 're total CQ , Bateman .
How did you guess ?
Because he dated her .
I know her .
I knew her .
But <unk> <unk> is a total <unk> .
What do you think , Bateman ?
Nice .
<unk> with <unk> type .
What do you think ?
That 's bone .
And the lettering is something called <unk> <unk> .
Good <unk> .
Picked them up from the <unk> yesterday What are the rules for a <unk> vest ?
You 'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar <unk> , but there are <unk> differences between us .
McDermott is the biggest asshole .
Van Patten is the yes man .
Price is the most wired .
I 'm the best looking .
We all have light <unk> .
Right now I 'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table , and Van Patten keeps asking dumb , obvious questions about how to dress .
I won 't ... don 't worry .
Don 't come back .
Don 't make any trouble .
Please .
I suggest you go .
But I think ... I want to know what happened here .
I think you should go now .
There was no ad in the Times .
No .
Yes .
I mean yes , I did .
In the Times .
But ... doesn 't Paul Owen still live here ?
You saw the ad in the Times ?
Are you sure ?
No , he doesn 't .
Doesn 't he live here ?
I 'm looking for ... Paul Owen 's ... place .
Can I help you ?
No .
Are you my two o 'clock ?
Now , if you 'll excuse me .
No , you ... didn 't ?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London ... just ten days ago .
Why not , you stupid bastard ?
It 's just not .
It never was supposed to he !
Why isn 't it possible ?
But that 's simply not possible .
And I don 't find this funny anymore .
Now , Carnes , listen to me .
Listen very , very carefully .
I killed Paul Owen and I liked it .
I can 't make myself any <unk> No !
Listen , don 't you know who I am ?
I 'm not Davis , I 'm Patrick Bateman !
I talk to you on the phone all the time !
Don 't you recognize me ?
You 're my lawyer .
Excuse me .
I really must he going .
Wait .
Stop .
You don 't seem to understand .
You 're not really <unk> any of this .
I killed him .
I did it , Carnes .
I 'm Patrick Bateman .
I chopped Owen 's fucking head off .
I <unk> <unk> of girls .
The whole message I left on your machine was true .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I really must ... Oh Christ .
He can barely pick up an escort girl , let alone ... what was it you said he did to her ?
What are you talking about ?
Bateman is what ?
Davis .
I 'm not one to <unk> anyone , your joke was amusing .
But come on , man , you had one fatal flaw : Bateman 's such a dork , such a boring , <unk> <unk> , that I couldn 't fully appreciate it .
I wasn 't fooled for a second .
Now , if you 'd said Price , or McDermott ... Otherwise , it was amusing .
Now , let 's have lunch or dinner or something .
<unk> , Davis .
A killer .
Carnes ?
Wait .
But wait , <unk> , what do you mean ?
By the way Davis , how is <unk> ?
You 're still seeing her , right ?
The message you left .
What exactly do you mean ?
It was a pretty long message , wasn 't it ?
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls ?
Oh that s fabulous .
That 's rich ...
Yes , naturally .
Jesus , Davis .
Yes .
That was <unk> .
That was you , wasn 't it ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> will own most of this country by the end of the ' <unk> .
Excuse me , gentlemen .
Right back .
He <unk> Carnes cautiously .
What ?

Patrick ?
I 've gotta ... I 've gotta ... return some videotapes .
Where are you going ?
What ... is ... it ?
Jesus lives , Luis .

Where are you going ?
We 're going to Nell 's .
Gwendolyn 's father 's buying it .
Where did you get your overnight bag ?
No , Luis .
It 's not me .
You 're mistaken .
Patrick ?
Is that you ?
Your compliment was <unk> Luis .
It looks so soft .
Uh huh .
That 's a wonderful <unk> .
Let me guess , <unk> <unk> ?
Lucky , I guess .
Patrick , thanks so much for looking after Courtney .
Dorsia , how <unk> !

He 's at <unk> .
<unk> .
Very nice .
Let 's see Paul Owen 's card .
<unk> lettering , <unk> <unk> white ...
But wait .
You ain 't seen nothin ' yet .
I can 't believe that Price prefers McDermott 's card to mine .
New card .
What do you think ?
What 's that , a gram ?
Well , we have to end <unk> for one .
And slow down the nuclear arms race , stop <unk> and world <unk> .
But we can 't ignore our social needs .
either We have to stop people from <unk> the welfare system .
We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and <unk> <unk> <unk> and promote civil rights while also <unk> equal rights for women but change the <unk> <unk> to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women 's <unk> of choice .
Like what ?
Oh come on .
Price .
There are a lot more important problems than <unk> <unk> to worry about .
Sure our foreign policy is important , but there are more pressing problems at hand .
I guess you 're right ... THAT <unk> , <unk> THE <unk> IN THE <unk> <unk> <unk> IT 'S <unk> !
Calm down .
Let 's do it anyway <unk> <unk> !
I want to get high off this ; Bateman , not <unk> it on my fucking <unk> .
It 's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we 'll be okay .
It 's a fucking milligram of Sweet 'n Low !
What ?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram ?
Oh my God ... Maybe it 's just the light .
Jeez .
That 's not a helluva lot , is it ?
Oh , who knows ?
They don 't know that .
<unk> it .
I 'm not sure , guy , but I don 't think dyslexia is a virus .
There 's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is <unk> , then you can also catch <unk> 's , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dyslexia , for Christ 's <unk> can get dyslexia from <unk> That 's not Paul Owen .
Paul Owen 's on the other side of the room .
Over there .
That 's Paul Owen .
It looks that way , doesn 't it ?
Van Patten looks <unk> .
Has he stopped working out ?
See you then .
There are no tables available tonight .
The waiting list is also totally booked .
Two at nine ?
Perfect .
I said we are totally booked .
Oh really ?
That 's great .
We are totally booked .
Yes , can you take two tonight , oh , let 's say at nine o 'clock ?
Dorsia , yes ?
Your friend has already been <unk> .
Follow me , Mr. Halberstam .
Marcus Halberstam .
For two at eight ?

Dorsia .
Stop sounding so Fucking sad !

Are you alright ?
Just ... say ... no !
Why ?

Thanks .
It slipped my mind completely .
And don 't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick <unk> and Charles <unk> at ' 21 .
No .
No , I guess not .
I don 't want to get <unk> .
You 're right , I should go .
If you stay , I think something bad will happen .
I think I might hurt you .
You don 't want to get hurt , do you ?
I know I should go .
I know I have a tendency to get involved with <unk> men , and ... I mean , do you want me to go ?
Yes .
I don t think I can ... control myself .
Hmmmm .
I 'm looking for ... I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special .
Make someone <unk> you ever wanted to ?
Jean ?
What ?
Sorry .
What ... No !
Put it in the <unk> .
Patrick , have you ever wanted to make someone happy ?
Oh .
Uh , tape .
<unk> tape .

Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun .
What 's that ?
Forget it .
Who 's Ted Bundy ?
Did you know that Ted Bundy 's first dog , a <unk> , was named <unk> ?
Had you heard this ?
<unk> .
I 'm glad you said that .

Well .
Hello Hi , Patrick .
I thought that was you .
You actually listen to Whitney Houston ?
You actually have a Whitney Houston <unk> ?
More than one ?
Did you know that Whitney Houston 's <unk> <unk> called simply Whitney Houston had four <unk> <unk> on it ?
Did you know that , Christie ?
Whitney 's voice <unk> across so many <unk> and is so <unk> she 's <unk> a <unk> <unk> it 's hard to take in the <unk> on a first listening .
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys , Patrick .
You 're making me feel weird .
Well , you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing .
No !
I 'm not a lesbian .
Why do you think I 'd be into that ?
Are you telling me you 've never gotten it on with a girl ?
Does he do this all the time ?
Come on .
I think it would be a turn-on .
Let 's not get lewd .
I 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
Come on .
Don 't you find Christie attractive ?
Patrick , you re a lunatic .
Listen , I would just like to see ... the two of you ... get it on .
What 's wrong with that ?
It 's totally <unk> .
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?
I 'd take a Halcyon .
No .
Did you know that guy who disappeared ?
Didn 't he work at Pierce & Pierce , too ?
Was he a friend of yours ?
I want the number , idiot .
Anyway , I 'm at Paul <unk> 's and I 'll try you later and if I don 't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I 'm going to <unk> my hairdresser on you .
Paul Owen .
Who ?
You 're at Paul Owen s . This <unk> weird .
Harley ?
It 's me .
I need your services .

I 'm <unk> Why would I ?
Don 't tell him you 're here .
He 's a goddamn drug dealer !
These are his <unk> hours .
Elizabeth , it 's three in the morning .
She 's from ... France .
Uh huh ?
She 's my ... cousin .
If you had an American Express card she 'd give you a <unk> .
Listen , this girl worked in a <unk> salon , need I say more ? ... What do you do ?
What do you mean , she was a hot number .
Personally I think the guy went a little <unk> .
<unk> town for a while .
Maybe he did go to London .
<unk> .
Drinking .
Whatever .
Anyway , I 'm pretty sure he 'll turn up sooner or later .
I mean , to think that one of his friends killed him , for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous .
Isn 't that right , Patrick ?
Oh , right .
Of course ... We had wanted Paul Owen to come .
But he said he had plans ... I guess I had dinner with Victoria ... the following night .
He was at <unk> with Craig McDermott , Frederick <unk> , Harry <unk> , George <unk> and - you .
So who was he with ?
He wasn 't with Paul Owen .
Where was Marcus ?
Oh .
KIMBALL Now where were you ?
I checked it out .
It 's clean .
He does ?
You 're sure ?
Yes .
Well , does Marcus have an alibi ?
Yes .
But Marcus <unk> it ?
Yes .
And he denies it .
Though at first he couldn 't be sure .
Marcus ?
I 've questioned him .
And ?
According to his date book , and this was <unk> by his secretary , he had dinner with ... Marcus Halberstam .
But how ?
Where do you place Paul that night ?
I think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up .
I 'm not really sure .
I had a shower ... and some <unk> ?
So , the night he disappeared ?
Any new thoughts on what you did ?
Suit yourself , I guess .
Yes , of course .
The hash browns are delicious .
I 'm just ... not ... <unk> them .
But ... everyone orders the hash browns here .
I <unk> it <unk> you been here before ?
Not in the mood , I guess .
No hash browns ?
I 'll be there .
Well , to each his own .
<unk> , Thursday ?
I 'll call your secretary about reservations .
No , I like music .
<unk> <unk> 's too ... black sounding .
For me .
Not a big music fan , eh ?
Never .
I mean ... I don 't really like ... <unk> .
Absolutely .
I 'm with you on that one .
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen 's disappearance , it would make my job a lot easier .
Great , yes , I 'd like that .
Listen , I 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I 've <unk> out all this information ?
Patrick , please .
I hope I 've been <unk> .
Long <unk> bit <unk> .
Well , thank you , Mr. Bateman .
We had ... gone to a new musical called ... Oh Africa , <unk> Africa .
It was ... a laugh riot ... and that 's about it .
I think we had dinner at Orso 's .
No , <unk> .
No , Orso 's .
The ... last time I physically saw him was ... at an automated <unk> .
I can 't remember which ... just one that was near , um , Nell 's .
Well ... When was the last time you were with Paul Owen ?
Well , I could he wrong .
Let 's see ... That you were <unk> Well ... I ... Wait ... What information have you received ?
That 's not the information I 've received .
What ?
Wait .
That 's not what I 've got .
I had a date with a girl named Veronica .
God ... I guess ... I was probably returning videotapes .
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul 's disappearance ?
Which was on the <unk> of December ?
Not really .
Yeah , gone into <unk> .
<unk> .
Is he a suspect ?
I actually came to see <unk> Price , but he 's taken a leave of absence .
Dan , great to see you again .
Like I said , you need anything at all , I 'm your man .
I don 't <unk> your job .
I mean Owen was a ... complex man .
I mean they want to get caught .
Too true .
You know , <unk> tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they 're in a <unk> setting , don 't you think ?
Yeah .
No <unk> , as usual .
Fucking dump .
<unk> no .
<unk> <unk> , mostly .
What 's that , <unk> ?
How 's the investigation going ?
<unk> anyone in for " formal questioning ? "
Uh , yes ... I mean ... whenever necessary .
You know .
So ... you hang out here a lot ?
Don .
Detective <unk> ... uh <unk> ?
KIMBALL Kimball .
Call me Don .
Great , and thanks for your , uh , time , Mr. Bateman .
Absolutely , I 'm 100 <unk> with you .

You 'll have to excuse me .
I have a lunch meeting with <unk> <unk> at Four Seasons in twenty minutes .

Really <unk> .
The earth just opens up and <unk> people .
People just ... <unk> .
Nothing .
It 's just strange .
One day someone 's walking around , going to work , alive , and then ... That 's so <unk> , isn 't it ?
No , not yet .
As I said , we 're not sure .
But ... <unk> no one has seen or heard anything .
I mean no one 's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything , right ?
No , it actually hadn 't .

A suit was gone .
So was some luggage .
That 's it .
Had his apartment been burglarized ?
No .
Have you <unk> a <unk> ?
Yeah , I know , and was into that whole Yale thing .
<unk> !
No .
Paul wasn 't into that .
He <unk> a balanced diet <unk> I know it sounds like a lame question , but in New <unk> I know this sounds like a lame question , but last <unk> don 't know if you 've heard about this , but a young <unk> was recently arrested and charged with <unk> a young <unk> girl and <unk> <unk> <unk> with various body <unk> What ?
Was he involved at all , do you think , in <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
Oh .
Well , I 've had a hard time getting an actual <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> says he saw him at a <unk> there , but I checked it out and what happened is , he <unk> a Hubert <unk> for Paul , so ... Hmmm .
Actually , yes .
But ... has anyone seen him in London ?
His girlfriend doesn 't think so .
Well , maybe he did , huh ?
Well , there 's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London .
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints ?
So was I.
We were both seven in <unk> .
Anything else you can tell me about Owen ?
I just wanted to know if you know .
BATEMAN Before Yale ?
If I remember correctly , <unk> Paul 's ...
Listen , I just ... I just want to help .
Don 't you know this ?
And where did he go to school ?

Not really .
Do you feel that way ?
I hope I 'm not being <unk> here .
What kind of man was he ?
Besides ... the information you 've just given .
He <unk> what I suppose was an orderly life .
He ... ate a balanced diet .
So ... there 's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen ?
What do you mean ... Yale thing ?
Yeah ... Yale thing .
Yale thing ?
I 'm ... at a loss .
He was part of that whole ... Yale thing , you know .
How well did you know him ?
Well ... What can you tell me about Paul Owen ?
No problem .
You sure ?
No , I guess it 's okay .
Would you rather I not smoke ?

Do you have a dog ?
A <unk> or something ?
Yes , Owen ?
Hey , Halberstam ?
They 're okay .
BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New <unk> for my taste .
But then <unk> came out in <unk> , I think they really came into their own , <unk> and <unk> .

Come on , you dumb son of a bitch .
I 've got a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and a bottle of <unk> waiting for us .

So , wasn 't <unk> <unk> handling the <unk> account ?

Not great ?
It 's ... it 's ... all right .
How 's the Ransom account going , Marcus ?
I 've been great .
And you ?
Hello , Halberstam .
Nice tie .
How the hell are you ?
Some guys are just born cool , I guess .
I just don 't see how someone , anyone , can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit .
How can you be so fucking , I don 't know , cool about it ?
I don 't believe it .
He looks so ... normal .
He seems so ... out of it .
So ... <unk> .
What shit ?
Now where do we have reservations at ?
I mean I 'm not really hungry , but I would like to have reservations somewhere .
How can he lie like that ?
How can he pull that shit ?
Good point .
Excuse me , gentlemen .
You 'll look like you <unk> worked for the look .
You think so ?
Anything ?
That 's not even <unk> .
If he wants to go up there ?
To check it out ?
I think you should <unk> him .
It 's his life .
But everybody 's treating him like this -- valuable object .
You 're hurting your own case .
I can 't help it .
I feel like they 'd do anything to keep their -- I can paint anywhere .
You don 't wanna move , do you ?
You know what he 's like .
He just wants to work on stuff that 's cool .
I 'm just screwed .
You know what I mean .
" Make " him ?
Alice ?
You gotta make him do the <unk> with Teddy and me .
<unk> wait outside .
You are a <unk> .
They still have to give ' em <unk> <unk> with <unk> drugs .
Is it over ?
You 're just afraid to eat it .
Right .
Wait .
A toast .
It 's gonna get cold .
... wanna <unk> this .
Great .
Here we go .
Oh , right .
Hold on .
Don 't we have any <unk> ?
Milo ?
I know you .
You 're gonna run back to work right after dinner .
I want my kiss now .
... What ?
Yeah ?
Give me a goodbye kiss .
You look beautiful .
Look at me !
I 'm gonna change .
Great !
Just shut up ?
No .
No .
I sent an E-mail to somebody , just now .
To tell her how I feel about you .
You know I 'm clueless , without you .
You know I -- I went to see the Skywire model in Gary 's office .
You know .
Just to hold it again .
Are you gonna tell me where you went ?
Milo , you -- I know you think I 'm too attached to him , but still .
I am close to Gary .
And you 're the most meaningful person in my life .
I 'm going back to the Comix place , why should I be killing myself .
Milo -- It 's for the <unk> .
He knows you 're a <unk> .
If anybody should be invited -- He has thousands of <unk> , Milo -- Why doesn 't he ask us to his party .
He 's never even met you .
What ?
Look at this .
Okay , yeah .
I did something <unk> ...
There 's this amazing Comix store in Seattle .
To tell you the truth , I did it once or twice at <unk> .
'Guess I can 't keep anything from you ... Where were you ?
You know you can 't keep anything from me .
... Different ?
That was -- different .
Poor baby .
You know that 's not true .
If I 'd stayed down there , maybe this wouldn <unk> happened .
<unk> ?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane , thank God they didn 't catch me !
-- I just drove around .
Trying to figure out what possessed me .
You know what ?
I 've been putting my own guilt on Gary .
I remember .
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- Remember <unk> Barton ?
... Why ?
It 's what they said it is .
An <unk> broadcast studio .
You were right ...
I just drove to Seattle and back .
Nothing ?
Nothing .
It 's almost nine , I 've been so worried !
What did you see in there ?
So you believe me ?
... <unk> I do ?
I know how to get in there .
But you 've gotta help me .
Is it two ?
Or is it three ?
Have you ever really noticed ?
They stop the construction work at six or seven .
The <unk> lot 's mostly clear by two or three in the morning .
Even the early <unk> don 't get there before five .
You can 't just walk in , either .
I can 't just walk away !
Milo , you told me those <unk> <unk> are all over the place .
How could they hope to hide a surveillance post ?
And how can you get in there , anyway ?
With the cameras and the <unk> cards -- It 's the only one with dishes on the roof .
The studio 's a front .
That 's why they keep <unk> its <unk> .
... gotta get in there .
Even if all this were true .
There 're 20 other buildings .
All of them filled with computers and -- How should I know ?
" <unk> a problem , " I guess .
Or needing to control everything .
I don 't know .
I 've gotta get in there .
Milo .
Why would he -- You think I don 't know that ?
" Like this ? "
It 's Gary you 're talking about .
Go where ?
You can 't get away from people like this .
You 're <unk> me .
I think we should just go .
It isn 't a broadcast studio .
It 's -- a surveillance post or something .
That 's why they have the dishes on top .
Nobody does work like this on-line .
It 's in your <unk> , or in a <unk> .
<unk> .
They 'd have to be , like , watching people .
Physically .
Oh Jesus .
They <unk> into people 's programs ?
I don 't know !
I just know it was Teddy 's code .
All these ideas flying in from everywhere .
You know how he says " Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business ? "
It 's like they know what every kid 's doing .
I can 't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that .
I don 't know what I 'm saying .
Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys .
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death ?
<unk> said it was an <unk> case .
It was a hate crime .
What 're you -- what ?
Teddy was killed last night .
What !
You 're right .
It 's -- a working relationship .
Don 't know what I was expecting .
I mean , if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- What 's extreme is what that <unk> doctor said when he <unk> your stomach .
Eat another <unk> <unk> and that 's it .
Isn 't that -- extreme ?
If you can 't deal with him on that <unk> , you better get a new counselor .
I know , I know .
He 's your boss .
He 's not your -- That 's what I 'm asking myself .
Does he have some genius <unk> away ?
Why not let him write Skywire .
'Not saying it makes sense .
What would it mean , anyway ?
If he didn 't write it ?
It 's the way he said it .
Just the way my dad did , when he was caught in a lie .
That 's how you knew you were onto something ugly .
He gave me some new <unk> this morning .
I said , " Did you really do this just today ? "
Cause I was impressed .
He said " What 're you implying ? "
That 's what I need to ask you .
You know you can 't keep anything from me .
To our new life .
... What 's wrong ?
Milo !
What about -- ?
You know he 's never been anybody 's counselor before ?
We 're not gonna let it .
That took some fun out of -- <unk> <unk> waiting by the phone for Outpost to call .
We 'll leave it for him ?
When 's Brian coming for the TV ?
You saved my life in <unk> of ways .
Don 't bring that up .
Like a different girlfriend would <unk> let you die ?
C 'mon , I wouldn 't have a destiny without you .
My destiny would be dying at 20 .
From eating -- No way .
You have this -- destiny .
I forgot .
That 's why you have to help me decide .
Didn 't you visit the <unk> ?
... But ?
I think that 's great , Milo .
I do .
If my dad 'd <unk> with me like that even once ...
The weird thing is , my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary ?
It 's his fantasy , too .
But he 's not quite the same guy anymore .
Don 't get your hopes too high ?
When I was a kid ?
And he was moving us all over the place ?
I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0 .
I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest .
<unk> ?
Are we talking about Gary Boyd ?
Or your dad .
If he 's really a <unk> , he won 't cop to it , anyway .
It 's important .
Then you 've gotta ask him about that .
A lot of what Larry says is true .
They just <unk> stuff , or reverse <unk> it , and everybody gets stuck with their <unk> version cause they -- C 'mon , how often do you talk to somebody who 's been on the cover of Time .
Three of four times .
I think I kind of lost it .
I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest , most powerful ... ' Didn 't know I even <unk> about that stuff .
I don 't think he knows how .
He wasn 't acting ?
He said it made sense that Gary 's code was like Teddy 's , that that <unk> about great minds was true .
Said it was all about his own guilt .
<unk> , he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while .
It always <unk> .
<unk> .
Lisa 's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team .
We 've got our eyes on her .
You keep yours on Milo .
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl .
Fire her .
Or something .
That 'll be a test , won 't it ?
He 'll tell me when he gets home .
Not like him , is it ?
To do a thing like that without telling you .
You 're not losing your hold on him , are you ?
No .
<unk> 't mention he was going to the Justice Department ?
Yes sir .
And Outpost ?
You 're happy there ?
'Just didn 't know who else to talk to .
Let me look into it , see what 's being done .
Frankly , it 's not my area .
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice .
They 're <unk> .
If there 's a <unk> <unk> violation .
But <unk> we let the local police and DA do their work first .
It was <unk> <unk> .
He 's <unk> .
He was .
And ...
I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that .
Don 't they ?
My goodness .
My friend , my best friend , Teddy , was killed in <unk> Valley .
Milo ?
I am .
I am , sir .
What seems to be the problem ?
You look a little upset .
Have a seat .
Yeah .
Hi .
Thank you for seeing me .
Milo ?
Give me two seconds with <unk> here ?
Go on in , I won 't be a moment .
Yes sir .
I need to talk to you .
... It 's -- Milo , isn 't it ?
Mr. Barton , do you remember me ?
Like I said : shot in the dark .
It 's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability .
Create something ... <unk> .
We 're at a <unk> with Outpost .
Our <unk> aren 't as smart as theirs .
Sometimes we can 't tell which <unk> <unk> the threat of a monopoly .
We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights .
I 'm taking a shot in the dark , here .
I can offer you <unk> a year , a <unk> .
I 'm hoping you 've got a feeling it 's the right thing to do .
Right ... What 's that mean again ?
Don 't worry , Milo .
I 'm here as a friend .
Or maybe a <unk> .
You should 've called a few times to bug me about your job <unk> .
... When did you know ?
He 's working backwards , too .
Let 's do number five ?
What ? !
Is it your dish ?
Is it your software ?
Gimme the <unk> ?
You 're <unk> with our dish .
Wanna be a part of history ?
What ? !
Great .
Great !
We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- Okay .
What 'd they ever do for you ?
What ?
No .
But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this .
We 're gonna bring down Outpost .
Will I get to work for Outpost ?
Brian !
You wanna be a big deal , don 't you ?
That 's your dream in life .
You can 't <unk> <unk> , that 's our biggest show .
This is the biggest <unk> <unk> in like the history of software .
You 'd be my partner .
<unk> to introduce you .
I have a girlfriend .
Well I parked illegally .
See y <unk> ?
Sure , I 'll see what I can do .
<unk> if I relocated it could help my case .
I 'm writing programs for the local public access station .
Where any <unk> with 100 bucks gets his own show ?
God , does it suck .
Can you help me ?
You 're living here ?
You better believe everybody 's trying to sign him up .
We tried !
Milo .
<unk> he 's not your <unk> .
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away ?
They 're calling him the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ?
Larry !
<unk> billion <unk> you some <unk> in this world .
Isn 't there a <unk> ?
<unk> this guy ?
There 's no hard evidence he knew about this .
Anybody who could <unk> him seems to 've <unk> .
That 'd change with a criminal <unk> .
<unk> 're <unk> up to <unk> the <unk> of the remaining satellites .
They 'll pay him a huge <unk> to get on-line .
Outpost doesn 't own em .
Outpost was his baby , sure .
On the other hand , we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites .
Personally .
That 's gotta kill him , right ?
I think they call him the " <unk> . "
'Cause " guard " sounds too weird .
Who 's that ?
He just likes to write code .
He 's bummed there 's so much <unk> and <unk> , everybody trying to own everything .
We could move ' em up here .
He 's pretty tight with his family .
<unk> 't convince Teddy to come ?
Oh hi .
Milo ?
I 'm <unk> .
I do know .
You focus on the big problem .
But somewhere down the chain , something breaks down .
Something gets destroyed .
At first it 's upsetting .
You feel you 've lost control .
I 'm pretty close .
But when I wrote the last contact <unk> , it <unk> out a piece of the content <unk> .
You know what it 's like , writing software .
I do know , Gary .
I feel the same way .
I thought I was coming here for a job .
But it 's meant a lot more .
I hope you know what you mean to me .
Not just because of what you 're doing .
Because of who you are .
You see what 's hanging on the wall ?
Gary , I -- Oh , that 's right .
You 're " clueless . "
I 'm not much good at handwriting .
Or parties .
You could 've <unk> it .
I couldn 't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons .
" Dear Lisa .
I 've <unk> working with you .
I 'd be lying if I didn 't say I find you attractive .
But in my heart I know that Alice ... " You left my party to send E-mail ?
<unk> about the late notice ... That 's great !
Thanks .
Don 't be so hard on yourself .
With a brain like yours , you could <unk> with the best of ' em I bet .
Cause he was a liar .
And I hated him .
" Get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world . "
The more he <unk> me the deeper I went .
Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that 's why I 'm kind of clueless , even now .
Didn 't <unk> my <unk> side .
'Not sure I even have one .
... <unk> ?
No .
I just went deeper into the machine .
<unk> being the <unk> to having to explain .
<unk> would 've been worse .
What would you tell the kids ?
At your new school ?
You had to come up with a good story , right ?
... My dad was a <unk> <unk> .
Only he didn 't think he was .
That <unk> to guys who didn 't have a " system . "
" <unk> , " who played games of chance .
He could " read " people , so chance had nothing to do with it .
No matter how deep a hole he dug himself , he 'd give you the whole speech .
And you 'd better not point out the obvious .
His creditors would catch up to him .
<unk> <unk> or whatever .
He 'd wake us in the middle of the night .
<unk> we 'd go , again .
Why did you move around so much ?
When you were a kid .
Sure .
<unk> a look ?
I 'm okay .
It 's going well !
You look a little tired .
Gary , hi .
The answer 's not in the box .
It 's in the band .
The wrong place ?
Been thinking about the push <unk> in the <unk> .
And it came over me : it 's in the wrong place .
<unk> .
But they 're real short lines .
'Just came out that way .
Wow .
You must have <unk> lines of code there ...
It <unk> .
Alice said it would help .
To focus on something .
<unk> 't know what I 'd do without her .
You 've been coming in early .
Oh .
Yeah .
I meant did you find other stuff to -- Talk about work ?
Never !
Did you ?
Just once .
'Guess I was worried we didn 't have anything to talk about , since work was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Had you talked to him much lately ?
Were the <unk> for Teddy ?
I heard what happened .
Definitely .
It <unk> , don 't you think ?
The purpose of this company isn 't to destroy our <unk> any more than the purpose of living is to breath .
But the software business is <unk> : you 're a zero or a one .
Being <unk> isn 't a crime .
It 's a <unk> <unk> .
I 'm sure .
Everything I do is under <unk> .
The questions they ask , trying to make anything <unk> look <unk> .
I 'm confused .
Doesn 't everybody in business try to get ahead ?
Nothing !
What 're you implying .
You really wrote this just today ?
Right ...
Right .
Well -- you sent for me .
Milo .
What 's up ?
You 're making me young again .
You did this -- overnight ?
Take a look at this .
<unk> different approach .
It 's okay .
Really .
Too fast ?
At least four companies 're on the verge of <unk> convergence systems , Milo , they -- Maybe I 'm going too fast .
How 's it going ?
Don 't spend too much time <unk> .
You ever <unk> somebody 's old code before ?
It 's a different <unk> .
Stay close to the surface .
The <unk> secrets are in plain sight .
You know the best place to hide a <unk> , right ?
In a tree .
Could work with a new switch .
There may be a few more things hidden .
That 's what I told her .
My wife .
That 's insane .
You 're ahead of your time .
Somebody said I 'm just another <unk> .
With <unk> .
... Do I ?
<unk> I should buy some originals ?
Okay .
I 'm Gary .
No !
Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself .
Yeah ?
I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that .
But I 'm <unk> , that 's 100 in <unk> .
I look at you and see the things that got me here .
But somehow got away .
I do !
When you get to a certain age , you start wondering .
About your <unk> .
I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 -- You 'd have to start practically from scratch .
But this is all you 'd be working on .
No <unk> meetings , no product <unk> .
We can 't waste the time .
Half the Valley 's working on convergence .
So 're media <unk> , <unk> companies , phone companies .
<unk> 't finish second , Milo .
There is no second ... Now what would you like to ask me ?
It needs a more <unk> language .
This doesn 't scale , does it ?
